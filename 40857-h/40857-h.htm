<h2><i>From Gretna Green to
Land's End</i></h2>


<hr style="width: 65%;" />
<h2><a name="THE_BORDER" id="THE_BORDER"></a>THE BORDER</h2>


<p>The dominant interest of the northwestern
counties is, of course, the
Lake District, with its far-famed poetic
associations; yet for the student of English
history and the lover of Border minstrelsy
the upper strip of Cumberland has a strong
attraction of its own.</p>

<p>An afternoon run on the Midland brought
us from Liverpool to Carlisle. Such are the
eccentricities of the English railway system
that the "through carriage" into which guard
and porter dumped us at Liverpool, a third-class
carriage already crowded with one sleeping
and one eating family, turned out not to
be a through carriage at all; and a new guard,
at Hellifield, tore us and our belongings forth
and thrust us into an empty first-class, lingering
in the doorway until we had produced the
inevitable shilling. But the freedom of an
empty carriage would have been well worth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the honest price of first-class tickets, for as the
train sped on from the Ribble into the Eden
Valley, with the blue heights of the Pennine
range and the long reaches of the Yorkshire
moors on our right, and on our left the
cloud-caressed summits of Lakeland, we
needed all the space there was for our exultant
<i>ohs</i> and <i>ahs</i>, not to mention our continual
rushing from window to window for
the swiftly vanishing views of grey castle and
ruined abbey, peel tower and stone sheep-fold,
grange and hamlet, and the exquisite,
ever-changing panorama of the mist.</p>

<p>Carlisle, "the Border City," a clean, self-respecting,
serious town, without beggars,
with no superfluous street courtesies, but with
effectual aid in need, is the heart of one of the
most storied regions of England. The River
Drift man and the Cave man seem to have
fought the mammoth and the elk and gone
their shadowy way untraced in this locality,
but the museum in Tullie House contains
hammers and axes, found in Cumberland soil,
of the Stone Age, and spear-heads and arrow-heads,
urns for human ashes, incense cups,
food vessels and drinking vessels of the Bronze
Age,&mdash;mute memorials of life that once was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
lived so eagerly beneath these same soft,
brooding skies.</p>

<p>As for the Romans, they seem here like a
race of yesterday. A penny tram took us,
in the clear, quiet light of what at home would
be the middle of the evening, out to Stanwix,
originally, it is believed, an important station
in the series of fortresses that guarded the
northern boundary of Roman Britain. These
frontier lines consisted of a great stone wall,
eight feet thick and eighteen feet high, ditched
and set with forts and towers, running straight
from the Solway to the Tyne, a distance of
some seventy-three miles, and a little to the
south of this, what is known as the <i>vallum</i>,
a fosse with mounds of soil and rock on either
side. The local antiquaries, urged on by a
committee of Oxford men, have recently discovered
a third wall, built of sods, between
the two, and excavation and discussion have
received a fresh impetus. Was the <i>vallum</i>
built by Agricola,&mdash;earthworks thrown up
by that adventurous general of the first Christian
century to secure his conquest? Was
the turf wall the erection of the great emperor
Hadrian, who visited Britain in the year 120,
and was the huge stone rampart constructed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
early in the third century, by the Emperor
Severus? Or does the stone wall date from
Hadrian? Or did he build all three?</p>

<p>While the scholars literally dig for truth,
we may sit on the site of this mighty, well-nigh
perished bulwark at Stanwix, with what
is perhaps the wrinkle left on the landscape
by the wall's deep moat dropping, under a
screen of hawthorns and wind-silvered poplars,
sheer at our feet, and thence we may look
out across the Eden, with its dipping gulls
and sailing swans, its hurrying swifts and
little dancing eddy, to the heights of Carlisle.
For the city is built on a natural eminence
almost encircled by the Eden and its tributaries,
the Petteril and the Caldew. It is a
fine view even now, with the level light centred
on the red sandstone walls of the grim
castle, though factory chimneys push into
the upper air, overtopping both the castle and
its grave neighbour, the cathedral; but for
mass and dignity, for significance, these two
are unapproachable: these are Carlisle.</p>

<p>We must not see them yet. We must see a
lonely bluff set over with the round clay huts of
the Britons, and then, as the Roman legions
sweep these like so many mole-hills from their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
path, we must see in gradual growth a Roman
town,&mdash;not luxurious, with the tessellated
marble pavements and elaborate baths that
have left their splendid fragments farther
south, but a busy trading-point serving the
needs of that frontier line of garrisons which
numbered no less than fifteen thousand men.
Some few inscribed and sculptured stones,
remnants of altars, tombs, and the like, may
be seen in the museum, with lamps, dishes,
and other specimens of such coarse and simple
pottery as was in daily use by common Roman
folk when the days and the nights were
theirs.</p>

<p>The name Carlisle&mdash;and it is said to be
the only city of England which bears a purely
British name&mdash;was originally Caer Lywelydd,
British enough in very sooth. This the Romans
altered to Lugubalia, and when, in
409, the garrisons of the Wall were recalled
for the protection of Rome herself, the Britons
of the neighbourhood made it their centre, and
it passed into Arthurian tradition as Cardueil.
Even the ballads vaguely sing of a time
when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"King Arthur lived in Merry Carlisle<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And seemly was to see."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span></div></div>

<p>But although the Britons sometimes united,
under one hero or a succession of heroes, to
save the land, now abandoned by the Romans,
from the Saxons, they were often at war
among themselves, and the headship of their
northern confederacy was wrested from Carlisle
and transferred to Dumbarton on the
Clyde. The kingdom of the Cumbrian
Britons, thenceforth known as Strathclyde,
fell before the assault of the English kingdom
of Northumbria, in which the Christian
faith had taken deep root. For though the
Britons, in the fourth century of Roman rule,
had accepted Christianity, the Angles had
come in with their own gods, and a new conversion
of the north, effected by missionaries
from Iona, took place about the sixth century.
Sculptured crosses of this period still remain
in Cumberland and Westmoreland, and the
Carlisle museum preserves, in Runic letters,
a Christian epitaph of "Cimokom, Alh's
queen."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Holy into ruin she went,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is the eloquent record, and from her grave-mound
she utters the new hope:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"My body the all-loving Christ<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Young again shall renew after death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But indeed sorrowing tear-flow<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Never shall afflict me more."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>For a moment the mists that have gathered
about the shelving rock to which we are looking
not merely across the Eden, but across
the river of time, divide and reveal the figure
of Cuthbert, the great monk of Northumbria,
to whom King Egfrith had committed the
charge of his newly founded monastery at
Caerluel. The Venerable Bede tells how,
while the king had gone up into Scotland on
a daring expedition against the Picts, in 685,
Cuthbert visited the city, whose officials, for
his better entertainment, took him to view
a Roman fountain of choice workmanship.
But he stood beside its carven rim with absent
look, leaning on his staff, and murmured:
"Perchance even now the conflict is
decided." And so it was, to the downfall
of Egfrith's power and the confusion of the
north. After the ravaging Scots and Picts
came the piratical Danes, and, about 875,
what was left of Carlisle went up in flame. A
rusted sword or two in the museum tells the
fierce story of the Danish sack. At the end<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
of the tenth century Cumberland was ceded
to Scotland, but was recovered by William
Rufus, son of William the Conqueror. Carlisle,
the only city added to England since the
Norman conquest, was then a heap of ruins;
but in 1092, says the "Anglo-Saxon Chronicle,"
the king "went northward with a great
army, and set up the wall of Carluel, and
reared the castle."</p>

<p>No longer</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The sun shines fair on Carlisle wall,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but there is still the castle, which even the
most precipitate tourist does not fail to visit.
We went in one of those wild blusters of wind
and rain which are rightly characteristic of
this city of tempestuous history, and had to
cling to the battlements to keep our footing
on the rampart walk. We peeped out through
the long slits of the loop-holes, but saw no
more formidable enemies than storm-clouds
rising from the north. The situation was unfavourable
to historic reminiscence, nor did
the blatant guide below, who hammered our
ears with items of dubious information, help
us to a realisation of the castle's robust career.
Yet for those who have eyes to read, the stones<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
of these stern towers are a chronicle of ancient
reigns and furious wars, dare-devil adventures
and piteous tragedy.</p>

<p>The Norman fortress seems to have been
reared upon the site of a Roman stronghold,
whose walls and conduits are still traceable.
After William Rufus came other royal builders,
notably Edward I and Richard III. It
was in the reign of the first Edward that Carlisle
won royal favour by a spirited defence
against her Scottish neighbours, the men of
Annandale, who, forty thousand strong,
marched red-handed across the Border. A
Scottish spy within the city set it on fire, but
while the men of Carlisle fought the flames,
the women scrambled to the walls and, rolling
down stones on the assailants and showering
them with boiling water, kept them off
until an ingenious burgher, venturing out on
the platform above the gate, fished up, with
a stout hook, the leader of the besiegers and
held him high in the air while lances and
arrows pierced him through and through.
This irregular mode of warfare was too much
for the men of Annandale, who marched
home in disgust.</p>

<p>During Edward's wars against Wallace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
he made Carlisle his headquarters. Twice
he held Parliaments there, and it was from
Carlisle he set forth, a dying king, on his last
expedition against the Scots. In four days
he had ridden but six miles, and then breath
left the exhausted body. His death was kept
secret until his son could reach Carlisle, which
witnessed, in that eventful July of 1307, a
solemn gathering of the barons of England to
mourn above the bier of their great war-lord
and pay their homage to the ill-starred Edward
II. A quarter century later, Lord
Dacre, then captain of Carlisle Castle, opened
its gates to a royal fugitive from Scotland,
Balliol; and Edward III, taking up the cause
of the rejected sovereign, made war, from Carlisle
as his headquarters, on the Scots. After
the Wars of the Roses, Edward IV committed
the north of England to the charge of
his brother Gloucester, who bore the titles
of Lord Warden of the Marches and Captain
of Carlisle Castle. Monster though tradition
has made him, Richard III seems to
have had a sense of beauty, for Richard's
Tower still shows mouldings and other ornamental
touches unusual in the northern
architecture of the period.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span></p>

<p>But the royal memory which most of all
casts a glamour over Carlisle Castle is that
of Mary, Queen of Scots. Fleeing from her
own subjects, she came to England, in 1568,
a self-invited guest. She landed from a
fishing-boat at Workington, on the Cumberland
coast,&mdash;a decisive moment which
Wordsworth has crystallised in a sonnet:</p>

<span class="i0">"Dear to the Loves, and to the Graces vowed,<br /></span>

<p>Mary was escorted with all courtesy to
Cockermouth Castle and thence to Carlisle,
where hospitality soon became imprisonment.
Her first request of Elizabeth was for
clothing, and it was in one of the deep-walled
rooms of Queen Mary's Tower, of which
only the gateway now remains, that she impatiently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
looked on while her ladies opened
Elizabeth's packet to find&mdash;"two torn shifts,
two pieces of black velvet, and two pairs of
shoes." The parsimony of Queen Bess has
a curious echo in the words of Sir Francis
Knollys, who, set to keep this disquieting
guest under close surveillance, was much
concerned when she took to sending to Edinburgh
for "coffers of apparell," especially
as she did not pay the messengers, so that
Elizabeth, after all, was "like to bear the
charges" of Mary's vanity. The captive
queen was allowed a semblance of freedom
in Carlisle. She walked the terrace of the
outer ward of the castle, went to service in
the cathedral, and sometimes, with her ladies,
strolled in the meadows beside the Eden, or
watched her gentlemen play a game of football,
or even hunted the hare, although her
warders were in a fever of anxiety whenever
she was on horseback lest she should take it
into her wilful, beautiful head to gallop back
to Scotland.</p>

<p>But these frowning towers have more terrible
records of captivity. Under the old Norman
keep are hideous black vaults, with the
narrowest of slits for the admission of air and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
with the walls still showing the rivet-holes
of the chains by which the hapless prisoners
were so heavily fettered.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Full fifteen stane o' Spanish iron<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They hae laid a'right sair on me;<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Rude devices, supposed to be the pastime
of captives, are carved upon the walls of a
mural chamber,&mdash;a chamber which has
special significance for the reader of "Waverley,"
as here, it is said, Major Macdonald,
the original of Fergus MacIvor, was confined.
For Carlisle Castle was never more cruel than
to the Jacobites of 1745. On November 18
Bonny Prince Charlie, preceded by one hundred
Highland pipers, had made triumphal
entrance into the surrendered city, through
which he passed again, on the 21st of December,
in retreat. Carlisle was speedily retaken
by the English troops, and its garrison,
including Jemmy Dawson of Jacobite song,
sent in ignominy to London. Even so the
cells of the castle were crammed with prisoners,
mainly Scots, who were borne to death
in batches. Pinioned in the castle courtyard,
seated on black hurdles drawn by white horses,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
with the executioner, axe in hand, crouching
behind, they were drawn, to make a Carlisle
holiday, under the gloomy arch of the castle
gate, through the thronged and staring street,
and along the London road to Harraby Hill,
where they suffered, one after another, the
barbarous penalty for high treason. The
ghastly heads were set up on pikes over the
castle gates (yetts), as Scotch balladry well
remembers.</p>

<p>But not all the ballads of Carlisle Castle
are tragic. Blithe enough is the one that tells
how the Lochmaben harper outwitted the
warden, who, when the minstrel, mounted
on a grey mare, rode up to the castle gate,
invited him in to ply his craft.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then aye he harped, and aye he carped,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till a' the lordlings footed the floor;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But an the music was sae sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The groom had nae mind o' the stable door.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And aye he harped, and aye he carped,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till a' the nobles were fast asleep;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then quickly he took off his shoon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And softly down the stair did creep."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So he stole into the stable and slipped a
halter over the nose of a fine brown stallion
belonging to the warden and tied it to the grey
mare's tail. Then he turned them loose, and
she who had a foal at home would not once
let the brown horse bait,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But kept him a-galloping home to her foal."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>When the loss of the two horses was discovered
in the morning, the harper made
such ado that the warden paid him three
times over for the grey mare.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"And verra gude business," commented
our Scotch landlady.</p>

<p>The most famous of the Carlisle Castle
ballads relates the rescue of Kinmont Willie,
a high-handed cattle-thief of the Border. For
between the recognised English and Scottish
boundaries lay a strip of so-called Debatable
Land, whose settlers, known as the Batables,
owed allegiance to neither country,
but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sought the beeves, that made their broth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Scotland and in England both."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This Border was a natural shelter for outlaws,
refugees, and "broken men" in general,&mdash;reckless
fellows who loved the wildness
and peril of the life, men of the type depicted
in "The Lay of the Last Minstrel."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A stark moss-trooping Scot was he,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As e'er couched Border lance by knee:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through Solway sands, through Tarras moss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blindfold, he knew the paths to cross;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By wily turns, by desperate bounds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had baffled Percy's best bloodhounds;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Eske, or Liddel, fords were none,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But he would ride them, one by one;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alike to him was time, or tide,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">December's snow or July's pride:<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Alike to him was tide, or time,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moonless midnight, or matin prime:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steady of heart, and stout of hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As ever drove prey from Cumberland;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Five times outlawed had he been,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By England's king and Scotland's queen."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Although these picturesque plunderers cost
the neighbourhood dear, they never failed
of sympathy in the hour of doom. The
Graemes, for instance, were a large clan who
lived by rapine. In 1600, when Elizabeth's
government compelled them to give a bond
of surety for one another's good behaviour,
they numbered more than four hundred
fighting men. There was Muckle Willie,
and Mickle Willie, and Nimble Willie, and
many a Willie more. But the execution of
Hughie the Graeme was none the less
grievous.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Gude Lord Scroope's to the hunting gane,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He has ridden o'er moss and muir;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he has grippit Hughie the Graeme,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For stealing o' the Bishop's mare.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<hr class="hrp" /><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Then they have grippit Hughie the Graeme,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And brought him up through Carlisle toun;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lasses and lads stood on the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Crying, 'Hughie the Graeme, thou 'se ne'er gae doun.'"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></div></div>

<p>They tried him by a jury of men,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The best that were in Carlisle toun,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and although his guilt was open, "gude Lord
Hume" offered the judge "twenty white
owsen" to let him off, and "gude lady Hume"
"a peck of white pennies," but it was of no
avail, and Hughie went gallantly to his death.</p>

<p>For these Batables had their own code of
right and wrong, and were, in their peculiar
way, men of honour. There was Hobbie
Noble, an English outlaw, who was betrayed
by a comrade for English gold, and who,
hanged at Carlisle, expressed on the gallows
his execration of such conduct.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I wad hae betray'd nae lad alive,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For a' the gowd o' Christentie."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The seizure of Kinmont Willie was hotly
resented, even though his clan, the Armstrongs,
who had built themselves strong
towers on the Debatable Land, "robbed,
spoiled, burned and murdered," as the
Warden of the West Marches complained,
all along upper Cumberland. The Armstrongs
could, at one time, muster out over
three thousand horsemen, and Dacres and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
Howards strove in vain to bring them under
control. Yet there was "Border law," too,
one of its provisions being that on the appointed
days of truce, when the "Lord
Wardens of England and Scotland, and Scotland
and England" met, each attended by a
numerous retinue, at a midway cairn, to hear
complaints from either side and administer
a rude sort of justice in accordance with "the
laws of the Marches," no man present, not
even the most notorious freebooter, could be
arrested. But William Armstrong of Kinmont
was too great a temptation; he had
harried Cumberland too long; and a troop
of some two hundred English stole after him,
as he rode off carelessly along the Liddel
bank, when the assemblage broke up, overpowered
him, and brought him in bonds to
Carlisle.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O have ye na heard o' the fause Sakelde?<br /></span>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></div></div>

<p>But this was more than the Scottish warden,
Sir Walter Scott of Buccleuch, could
bear.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And have they ta'en him, Kinmont Willie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Against the truce of the Border tide,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And have they ta'en him, Kinmont Willie,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Withouten either dread or fear,<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Can back a steed or shake a spear?<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"O! were there war between the lands,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As well I wot that there is nane,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I'll neither harm English lad or lass,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And yet the Kinmont freed shall be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>So Buccleuch rode out, one dark night,
with a small party of Borderers, and succeeded,
aided by one of the gusty storms of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>the region, in making his way to Carlisle
undetected.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And when we left the Staneshaw-bank,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But 'twas wind and weet, and fire and sleet,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The sudden uproar raised by the little band
bewildered the garrison, and to Kinmont
Willie, heavily ironed in the inner dungeon
and expecting death in the morning, came
the voices of friends.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>But his spirits rose to the occasion, and when
Red Rowan,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The starkest man in Teviotdale,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p><p>hoisted Kinmont Willie, whose fetters there
was no time to knock off, on his back and

</div></div>

<p>It is high time that we, too, escaped from
Carlisle Castle into the open-air delights of
the surrounding country. Five miles to the
east lies the pleasant village of Wetheral on
the Eden. Corby Castle, seat of a branch of
the great Howard family, crowns the wooded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
hill across the river, but we lingered in Wetheral
Church for the sake of one who may have
been an ancestor of "the fause Sakelde."
This stately sleeper is described as Sir Richard
Salkeld, "Captain and Keeper of Carlisle,"
who, at about the time of Henry VII, "in this
land was mickle of might." His effigy is
sadly battered; both arms are gone, a part
of a leg, and the whole body is marred and
dinted, with latter-day initials profanely
scrawled upon it. But he, lying on the outside,
has taken the brunt of abuse and, like
a chivalrous lord, protected Dame Jane, his
lady, whose alabaster gown still falls in even
folds.</p>

<p>We drove eastward ten miles farther, under
sun and shower, now by broad meadows
where sleek kine, secure at last from cattle-lifters,
were tranquilly grazing, now by solemn
ranks of Scotch firs and far-reaching parks
of smooth-barked, muscular beeches, now
through stone-paved hamlets above whose
shop-doors we would read the familiar ballad
names, Scott, Graham (Graeme), Armstrong,
Musgrave, Johnston, Kerr, and wonder how
the wild blood of the Border had been tamed
to the selling of picture postal cards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span></p>

<p>Our goal was Naworth, one of the most
romantic of English castles. Its two great
towers, as we approached, called imagination
back to the days</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When, from beneath the greenwood tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rode forth Lord Howard's chivalry,<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<hr class="hrp" /><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And minstrels, as they marched in order,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Played, 'Noble Lord Dacre, he dwells on the Border.'"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Naworth is the heart of a luxuriant valley.
The position owes its defensive strength to
the gorges cut by the Irthing and two tributaries.
These three streams, when supplemented
by the old moat, made Naworth an
island fortress. The seat of the Earls of Carlisle,
it was built by Ranulph Dacre in the
fourteenth century. Even the present Lady
Carlisle, a pronounced Liberal and a vigorous
worker in the causes of Temperance and
Woman Suffrage, though claiming to be a
more thoroughgoing Republican than any
of us in the United States, points out with
something akin to pride "the stone man" on
the Dacre Tower who has upheld the family
escutcheon there for a little matter of five
hundred years. In the sixteenth century the
Dacre lands passed by marriage to the Howards,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
and "Belted Will," as Sir Walter Scott
dubbed Lord William Howard, proved, under
Elizabeth and James, an efficient agent of
law and order. Two suits of his plate armour
still bear witness to the warrior, whom the
people called "Bauld Willie," with the same
homely directness that named his wife, in
recognition of the ample dower she brought
him, "Bessie with the braid apron," but his
tastes were scholarly and his disposition devout.
Lord William's Tower, with its rugged
stone walls, its loopholes and battlements,
its steep and narrow winding-stair guarded
by a massive iron door, its secret passage to
the dungeons, is feudal enough in suggestion,
yet here may be seen his library with the oak-panelled
roof and the great case of tempting
old folios, and here his oratory, with its fine
wood-carvings, its Flemish altar-piece, and
its deep-windowed recess outlooking on a fair
expanse of green earth and silver sky.</p>

<p>This castle, with its magnificent baronial
hall, its treasures of art and spirit of frank
hospitality, was harder to escape from than
Carlisle. There was no time to follow the
Irthing eastward to the point where, as the
Popping Stones tell, Walter Scott offered his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
warm heart and honest hand to the dark-eyed
daughter of a French <i>emigre</i>. But we could
not miss Lanercost, the beautiful ruined
abbey lying about a mile to the north of Naworth.
An Augustine foundation of the
twelfth century, it has its memories of Edward
I, who visited it with Queen Eleanor
in 1180 and came again in broken health, six
years later, to spend quietly in King Edward's
Tower the last winter of his life. The nave
now makes a noble parish church in which
windows by William Morris and Burne-Jones
glow like jewels. The choir is roofless,
but gracious in its ruin, its pavement
greened by moss, feathery grasses waving
from its lofty arcades, and its walls weathered
to all pensive, tender tints. The ancient
tombs, most of them bearing the scallop-shells
of the Dacres, are rich in sculpture.
Into the transept walls are built some square
grey stones of the Roman Wall, and a Roman
altar forms a part of the clerestory roof. The
crypt, too, contains several Roman altars,
dedicated to different gods whose figures,
after the lapse of two thousand years, are
startling in their spirited grace, their energy
of life.</p>

<p>But Lanercost reminds us that we have all
but ignored Carlisle Cathedral, and back we
drive, by way of the village of Brampton with
its curious old market-hall, to the Border
City. After all, we have only followed the
custom of the place in slighting the cathedral.
Carlisle was ever too busy fighting to pay
much heed to formal worship.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For mass or prayer can I rarely tarry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save to patter an <i>Ave Mary</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I ride on a Border foray."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The cathedral dates from the time of William
Rufus, and still retains two bays of its
Norman nave, which suffered from fire in
the early part of the thirteenth century. A
still more disastrous fire, toward the close of
that century, all but destroyed the new choir,
which it took the preoccupied citizens one
hundred years to rebuild, so that we see to-day
Early English arches in combination with
Decorated pillars and Late Decorated capitals.
These capitals of fresh and piquant designs
are an especial feature of the choir, whose
prime glory, however, is the great east window
with its perfect tracery, although only the
upper glass is old. The cathedral has suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
not alone from a series of fires, but from
military desecration. Part of its nave was
pulled down by the irreverent Roundheads
to repair the fortifications, and it was used
after Carlisle was retaken from Prince Charlie
as a prison for the garrison. Even to-day
canny Cumberland shows a grain too much
of frugality in pasturing sheep in the cathedral
graveyard. Carlisle Cathedral has numbered
among its archdeacons Paley of the
"Evidences," and among its archdeans Percy
of the "Reliques." Among its bridegrooms
was Walter Scott, who wedded here his raven-haired
lady of the Popping Stones.</p>

<p>One drive more before we seek the Lake
Country,&mdash;ten miles to the north, this time,
across the adventurous Esk, where a fierce
wind seemed to carry in it the shout of old
slogans and the clash and clang of arms, and
across the boundary stream, the Sark, to
Gretna Green, where breathless couples used
to be married by blacksmith or innkeeper
or the first man they met, the furious parents
posting after all in vain. Then around by
Longtown we drove and back to Carlisle,
across the Solway Moss,&mdash;reaches of blowing
grass in the foreground; dark, broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
bogs, where men and women were gathering
in the peat, in the middle distance; and beyond,
the blue folds of hills on hills. It was
already evening, but such was the witchery
of the scene, still with something eerie and
lawless about it despite an occasional farmhouse
with stuffed barns and plump ricks and
meadows of unmolested kine, that we would
gladly, like the old Borderers whose armorial
bearings so frequently included stars and
crescents, have spent the night in that Debatable
Land, with the moon for our accomplice
in moss-trooping.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAKE_COUNTRY" id="THE_LAKE_COUNTRY"></a>THE LAKE COUNTRY</h2>


<p>There are as many "best ways" of
making the tour of this enchanted land
as there are Lake Country guidebooks,
volumes which, at prices varying from ten
shillings to "tuppence," are everywhere in
evidence. One may journey by rail to Keswick
or to Windermere; one may come up
from Furness Abbey to Lakeside, passing
gradually from the softer scenery to the wilder;
or one may enter by way of Penrith and Pooley
Bridge, ushered at once into the presence of
some of the noblest mountains and perhaps
the loveliest lake.</p>

<p>This last was our route, and very satisfactory
we found it. Our stay at Penrith
had been abbreviated by a municipal councillors'
convention which left not a bed for
the stranger. We had been forewarned of
the religious convention which throngs Keswick
the last full week in July, and, indeed,
an evangelist bound thither had presented<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
us with tracts as we took our train at Carlisle.
But we had not reckoned on finding Penrith
in such plethoric condition, and, after an uphill
look at the broken red walls of Penrith
Castle, which, with Carlisle, Naworth, and
Cockermouth, stood for the defence of western
England against the Scots, we mounted a
motor-bus, of all atrocities, and were banged
and clanged along a few miles of fairly level
road which transferred us, as we crossed the
Eamont, from Cumberland to Westmoreland.
The hamlet of Pooley Bridge lies
at the lower end of Ullswater, up whose
mountain-hemmed reaches of ever-heightening
beauty we were borne by <i>The Raven</i>, a
leisurely little steamer with a ruddy captain
serenely assured that his lake is the queen of
all. The evening was cold and gusty,&mdash;rougher
weather than any we had encountered
in our midsummer voyage across the
Atlantic,&mdash;but, wrapped in our rugs and
shedding hairpins down the wind, we could
have sailed on forever, so glorious was that
sunset vision of great hills almost bending over
the riverlike lake that runs on joyously, as from
friend to friend, between the guardian ranks.</p>

<p>We lingered for a few days at the head of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
Ullswater, in Patterdale, and would gladly
have lingered longer, if only to watch the play
of light and shadow over St. Sunday Crag,
Place Fell, Stybarrow Crag, Fairfield, and all
that shouldering brotherhood of giants, but
we must needs take advantage of the first
clear day for the coach-drive to Ambleside,
over the Kirkstone Pass,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Aspiring Road! that lov'st to hide<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thy daring in a vapoury bourn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>A week at Ambleside, under Wansfell's
"visionary majesties of light," went all too
swiftly in the eager exploration of Grasmere
and Coniston, Hawkshead, Bowness, Windermere,
and those "lofty brethren," the Langdale
Pikes, with their famous rock-walled
cascade, Dungeon Ghyll. The coach-drive
from Ambleside to Keswick carried us, at
Dunmailraise, across again from Westmoreland
to Cumberland. Helvellyn and Thirlmere
dominated the way, but Skiddaw and
Derwent Water claimed our allegiance on
arrival. What is counted the finest coach-drive
in the kingdom, however, the twenty-four-mile
circuit from Keswick known as the
Buttermere Round, remained to bring us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
under a final subjection to the silver solitude
of Buttermere and Crummock Water and the
rugged menace of Honister Crag. The train
that hurried us from Keswick to Cockermouth
passed along the western shore of
pleasant Bassenthwaite Water, but from
Workington to Furness Abbey meres and
tarns, for all their romantic charm, were forgotten,
while, the salt wind on our faces, we
looked out, over sand and shingle, on the dim
grey vast of ocean.</p>

<p>The Lake Country, it is often said, has no
history. The tourist need not go from point
to point enquiring</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If here a warrior left a spell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Panting for glory as he fell;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or here a saint expired."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>That irregular circle of the Cumberland
Hills, varying from some forty to fifty miles
in diameter, a compact mass whose mountain
lines shut in narrow valleys, each with
its own lake, and radiate out from Helvellyn
in something like a starfish formation, bears,
for all its wildness, the humanised look of
land on which many generations of men have
lived and died; but the records of that life
are scant.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>There are several stone-circles, taken to be
the remains of British temples, the "mystic
Round of Druid frame," notably Long Meg
and her Daughters, near Penrith, and the
Druid's Circle, just out of Keswick. About
the Keswick circle such uncanny influences
still linger that no two persons can number
the stones alike, nor will your own second
count confirm your first. Storm and flood
rage against that mysterious shrine, but the
wizard blocks cannot be swept away. The
Romans, who had stations near Kendal, Penrith,
and Ambleside, have left some striking
remembrances, notably "that lone Camp on
Hardknott's height," and their proud road,
still well defined for at least fifteen miles,
along the top of High Street ridge. A storied
heap of stones awaits the climber at the top of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The long ascent of Dunmailraise."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here, in 945, the last king of the Cumbrian
Britons, Dunmail, was defeated by Edmund
of England in the pass between Grasmere
and Keswick. Seat Sandal and Steel Fell
looked down from either side upon his fall.
Edmund raised a cairn above what his Saxon
wits supposed was a slain king, but Dunmail<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
is only biding his time. His golden crown
was hurled into Grisedale Tarn, high up in
the range, where the shoulders of Helvellyn,
Seat Sandal, and Fairfield touch, and on the
last night of every year these dark warders
see a troop of Dunmail's men rise from the
tarn, where it is their duty to guard the crown,
bearing one more stone to throw down upon
the cairn. When the pile is high enough to
content the king, who counts each year in his
deep grave the crash of another falling stone,
he will rise and rule again over Cumberland.</p>

<p>Here history and folk-lore blend. Of pure
folk-lore the stranger hears but little. Eden
Hall, near Penrith, has a goblet filched from
the fairies:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If e'er this glass should break or fall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Farewell the luck of Eden Hall."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The enchanted rock in the Vale of St. John
is celebrated in Scott's "Bridal of Triermain."
St. Bees has a triumphant tradition of St.
Bega, who, determined to be a nun, ran away
from the Irish king, her father, for no better
reason than because he meant to marry her
to a Norwegian prince, and set sail in a fishing-boat
for the Cumberland coast. Her little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
craft was driven in by the storm to Whitehaven,
where she so won upon the sympathies
of the Countess of Egremont that this lady
besought her lord to give the fugitive land
for a convent. It was midsummer, and the
graceless husband made answer that he would
give as much as the snow should lie upon next
morning, but when he awoke and looked out
from the castle casement, his demesne for
three miles around was white with snow.</p>

<p>Wordsworth's "Song at the Feast of
Brougham Castle," "The Horn of Egremont
Castle," and "The Somnambulist" relate
three legends of the region, of varying degrees
of authenticity, and Lord's Island in
Derwent Water brings to mind the right
noble name of James Radcliffe, third and
last Earl of Derwentwater, who declared for
his friend and kinsman, the Pretender of
1715. On October sixth the young earl
bade his brave girl-wife farewell and rode
away to join the rebels, though his favourite
dog howled in the courtyard and his dapple-grey
started back from the gate. On October
fourteenth the cause was lost, and
the Earl of Derwentwater was among the
seventeen hundred who surrendered at Preston.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
In the Tower and again on the scaffold
his life was offered him if he would
acknowledge George I as rightful king and
would conform to the Protestant religion,
but he said it "would be too dear a purchase."
On the evening after his beheading the
Northern Lights flamed red over Keswick,
so that they are still known in the countryside
as Lord Derwentwater's Lights.</p>

<p>The dalesfolk could doubtless tell us more.
There may still be dwellers by Windermere
who have heard on stormy nights the ghastly
shrieks of the Crier of Claife, calling across
the lake for a ferry-boat, although it was long
ago that a valiant monk from Lady Holm
"laid" that troubled spirit, binding it, with
book and bell, to refrain from troubling "while
ivy is green"; and in the depths of Borrowdale,
on a wild dawn, old people may cower
deeper in their feather beds to shut out the
baying of the phantom hounds that hunt the
"barfoot stag" through Watendlath tarn and
over the fells down into Borrowdale. There
is said to be a local brownie, Hob-Thross by
name, sometimes seen, a "body aw ower
rough," lying by the fire at midnight. For
all his shaggy look, he has so sensitive a spirit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
that, indefatigable though he is in stealthy
household services, the least suggestion of
recompense sends him weeping away. He
will not even accept his daily dole of milk
save on the condition that it be set out for
him in a chipped bowl.</p>

<p>But, in the main, the Lake Country keeps
its secrets. The names are the telltales, and
these speak of Briton and Saxon and the adventurous
Viking. <i>Dale</i>, <i>fell</i>, <i>force</i> (waterfall),
<i>ghyll</i> (mountain ravine), <i>holm</i> (island),
<i>how</i> (mound), <i>scar</i> (cliff-face), are Icelandic
words. Mountain names that seem undignified,
as Coniston Old Man or Dolly Wagon
Pike, are probably mispronunciations of what
in the original Celtic or Scandinavian was of
grave import. There appears to be a present
tendency to substitute for the unintelligible
old names plain English terms usually suggested
by some peculiarity in the mountain
shape, but it is a pity to give up the
Celtic Blencathara, Peak of Demons, for
Saddleback.</p>

<p>The jubilant throngs who flock to Lakeland
every summer concern themselves little
with its early history. The English pour into
that blessed circuit of hills as into a great playground,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
coaching, walking, cycling, climbing,
boating, keenly alive to the beauty of the
scenery and eagerly drinking in the exhilaration
of the air. They love to tread the
loftiest crests, many of which are crowned
with cairns raised by these holiday climbers,
each adding his own stone. But it is
the shepherd who is in the confidence of
the mountains, he who has</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"been alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the heart of many thousand mists,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That came to him, and left him, on the heights."<br /></span>
</div></div>


<p>Wordsworth first learned to love humanity
in the person of the shepherd</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"descried in distant sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A solitary object and sublime."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sheep, too, are often seen against the sky-line,
and even the cow&mdash;that homelike beast who
favours you in her innocent rudeness, from the
gap of a hawthorn hedge, with that same prolonged,
rustic, curious stare that has taxed
your modesty in Vermont or Ohio&mdash;will forsake
the shade of "the honied sycamore" in
the valley for summits</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">"sharp and bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where oft the venturous heifer drinks the noontide breeze."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span></div></div>

<p>There have been fatal accidents upon the
more precipitous peaks. Scott and Wordsworth
have sung the fate of that "young lover
of Nature," Charles Gough, who, one hundred
years ago, fell from the Striding Edge
of Helvellyn and was watched over in death
for no less than three months by his little
yellow-haired terrier, there on the lonely
banks of Red Tarn, where her persistent
barking at last brought shepherds to the body.
In the Patterdale churchyard, whose famous
great yew is now no more, we noticed a stone
commemorating a more recent victim of Helvellyn,
a Manchester botanist, who had come
summer by summer to climb the mountain,
and who, a few years since, on his last essay,
a man of seventy-three, had died from exhaustion
during the ascent. The brow of
Helvellyn, now soft and silvery as a melting
dream, now a dark mass banded by broad
rainbows, overlooks his grave.</p>

<p>I remember that Nathan's story of the rich
man who "had no pity," but took for a guest's
dinner the "one little ewe lamb" of his poor
neighbour, was read in the Patterdale church
that evensong, and it was strange to see how
intently those sturdy mountain-lads, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
alert-eyed sheep dogs waiting about the door,
listened to the parable. Not only does the
Scripture imagery&mdash;"The Lord is my shepherd;
I shall not want"&mdash;but the phrasing
of the prayerbook&mdash;"We have erred and
strayed from Thy ways like lost sheep"&mdash;come
with enhanced significance in a pastoral
region.</p>

<p>Lakeland in the tourist season is not at its
best in point of flowers. The daffodils that
in Gowbarrow Park&mdash;recently acquired and
opened as a national preserve&mdash;rejoiced the
poet as they danced beside the dancing waves
of Ullswater, fade before July, and the patches
of ling and heather upon the mountain-sides
lack the abundance that purples the Scottish
hills, but the delicate harebell nods blithely
to the wayfarer from up among the rocks, and
the foxglove grows so tall, especially in the
higher passes, as to overtop those massive
boundaries into which the "wallers" pack
away all the loose stone they can.</p>

<p>Birds, too, are not, in midsummer, numerous
or varied. Where are Wordsworth's
cuckoo and skylark and green linnet? The
eagles have been dislodged from their eyries
on Eagle Crag. A heavily flapping raven,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
a congregation of rooks, a few swallows and
redbreasts, with perhaps a shy wagtail, may
be the only winged wanderers you will salute
in an hour's stroll, unless this, as is most likely,
has brought you where</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"plots of sparkling water tremble bright<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With thousand thousand twinkling points of light."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>There you will be all but sure to see your
Atlantic friends, the seagulls, circling slowly
within the mountain barriers like prisoners
of the air and adding their floating shadows
to the reflections in the lake below. For, as
Wordsworth notes,&mdash;what did Wordsworth
fail to note?&mdash;the water of these mountain
meres is crystal clear and renders back with
singular exactitude the "many-coloured images
imprest" upon it.</p>

<p>But the life of the Cumbrian hills is the life
of grazing flocks, of leaping waterfalls and
hidden streams with their "voice of unpretending
harmony,"&mdash;the life of sun and
shadow. Sometimes the sky is of a faint,
sweet blue with white clouds wandering in
it,&mdash;the old Greek myth of Apollo's flocks
in violet meadows; sometimes the keenest
radiance silvers the upper crest of <i>cumuli</i> that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
copy in form the massy summits below; sometimes
the mellow sunset gold is poured into
the valleys as into thirsty cups; but most often
curling mists wreathe the mountain-tops and
move in plumed procession along their naked
sides.</p>

<p>The scenic effects and the joy of climbing
are not lost by American tourists, yet these,
as a rule, come to the Lake Country in a
temper quite unlike that of the English holiday
seekers. We come as pilgrims to a Holy
Land of Song. We depend perhaps too little
upon our own immediate sense of grandeur
and beauty, and look perhaps too much to
Wordsworth to interpret for us "Nature's
old felicities." The Lake Country that has
loomed so large in poetry may even disappoint
us at the outset. The memory of the
Rockies, of our chain of Great Lakes, of
Niagara, may disconcert our first impressions
of this clump of hills with only four,
Scafell Pike, Scafell, Helvellyn, and Skiddaw,
exceeding three thousand feet in height;
of lakes that range from Windermere, ten
miles long and a mile broad, to the reedy little
pond of Rydal Water, more conventionally
termed "a fairy mere"; of waterfalls that are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
often chiefly remarkable, even Southey's Lodore,
for their lack of water. Scales Tarn,
of which Scott wrote,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Never sunbeam could discern<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The surface of that sable tarn,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whose black mirror you may spy<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The stars, while noontide lights the sky,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>is seventeen feet deep.</p>

</div>

<p>It is all in proportion, all picturesque,&mdash;almost
in too regular proportion, almost too
conspicuously picturesque, as if it had been
expressly gotten up for the "tripper." There
is nothing of primeval wildness about it. Nature
is here the lion tamed, an accredited
human playmate. Indeed, one almost feels
that here is Nature sitting for her portrait,
a self-conscious Nature holding her court of
tourists and poets. Yet this is but a fleeting
and a shamefaced mood. It takes intimacy
to discover the fact of reticence, and those are
aliens indeed who think that a single coach-drive,
even the boasted "circular tour," has
acquainted them with the Lake Country,&mdash;yes,
though they trudge over the passes (for
it is coach etiquette to put the passengers
down whenever the road gets steep) Wordsworth
in hand. In truth, the great amount
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>of literary association may be to the conscientious
"Laker" something of a burden.
Skiddaw thrusts forth his notched contour
with the insistent question: "What was it
Wordsworth said about me?" Ennerdale
church and the Pillar Rock tax one's memory
of "The Brothers," and every stone sheep-fold
calls for a recitation from "Michael."
That "cradled nursling of the mountain,"
the river Duddon, expects one to know by
heart the thirty-four sonnets recording how
the pedestrian poet</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"accompanied with faithful pace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cærulean Duddon from its cloud-fed spring."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The footpath you follow, the rock you rest
upon, the yew you turn to admire, Wishing-Gate
and Stepping-Stones admonish you to
be ready with your quotation. Even the tiny
cascade of Rydal Water&mdash;so small as presumably
to be put to bed at six o'clock, for it
may not be visited after that hour&mdash;has been
sung by the Grasmere laureate. While your
care-free Englishman goes clambering over
the golden-mossed rocks and far within the
slippery recesses of Dungeon Ghyll, your
serious American will sit him down amid the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
bracken and, tranquilly watched by Lingmoor
from across the vale, read "The Idle
Shepherd-Boys," and the exquisite description
of the scene in Mrs. Humphry Ward's
"Fenwick's Career." If he can recall Coleridge's
lines about the "sinful sextons' ghosts,"
so much the better, and if he is of a "thorough"
habit of mind, he will have read
through Wordsworth's "Excursion" in preparation
for this expedition to the Langdales
and be annotating the volume on his
knee.</p>

<p>There may be something a little naïve in
this studious attitude in the presence of natural
beauty, but the devotion is sincere. Many
a tourist, English and American, comes to
the Lake Country to render grateful homage
to those starry spirits who have clustered
there. Fox Howe, the home of Dr. Arnold
and dear to his poet son; The Knoll, home
of Harriet Martineau; and the Dove's Nest,
for a little while the abode of Mrs. Hemans,
are duly pointed out at Ambleside, but not
all who linger in that picture-book village and
climb the hill to the Church of St. Anne, standing
serene with its square, grey, pigeon-peopled
tower, know that Faber was a curate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
there in the youthful years before he "went
over to Rome." He lived hard by in what
is said to be the oldest house in Ambleside,
once a manor-house of distinction,&mdash;that
long, low stone building with small, deep-set
windows and the cheery touches of colour
given by the carefully tended flowers about the
doors. "A good few" people thought he was
not "just bright," our landlady told us, "because
he would be walking with his head
down, busy at his thoughts," yet Wordsworth
said that Faber was the only man he knew
who saw more things in Nature than he did
in a country ramble. Bowness cherishes
recollections of the gay, audacious doings of
Professor Wilson (Christopher North), and
Troutbeck plumes itself on being the birthplace
of Hogarth's father. Keswick, where
Shelley once made brief sojourn, holds the
poet-dust of Southey and of Frederic Myers,
and in Crosthwaite Vicarage may be found
a living poet of the Lakes, Canon Rawnsley,&mdash;a
name to conjure with throughout the
district, whose best traditions he fosters and
maintains.</p>

<p>Opposite Rydal Mount, at Nab Cottage,
dwelt, for the closing years of his clouded life,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
the darling of the dalesfolk, "Li'le Hartley,"
first-born son of Coleridge,&mdash;that boy "so
exquisitely wild" to whom had descended
something of his father's genius crossed by
the father's frailty. Hartley's demon was
not the craving for opium, but for alcohol.
After a sore struggle that crippled but did
not destroy, he rests in Grasmere churchyard,
his stone bearing the inscription, "By Thy
Cross and Passion." It was from Nab Cottage
that another soul of high endowment,
menaced by the opium lust, De Quincey, took
a bride, Margaret, a farmer's daughter, who
made him the strong and patient wife his peril
needed. They dwelt in Dove Cottage at
Townend, Grasmere, the hallowed garden-nest
where Wordsworth and his wife and his
sister Dorothy&mdash;that ardent spirit the
thought of whom is still "like a flash of light"&mdash;had
dwelt before. Wordsworth's later
homes at Allan Bank, the Grasmere Rectory,
and even at Rydal Mount are less precious
to memory than this, where he and Coleridge
and Dorothy dreamed the great dreams of
youth together. Thither came guests who
held high converse over frugal fare,&mdash;among
them Sir Walter Scott, Charles Lamb, "the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
frolic and the gentle," and that silent poet,
the beloved brother John. It was a plain and
thrifty life that Dove Cottage knew, with its
rustic little rooms and round of household
tasks, but thrift took on magic powers in the
Lake Country a century ago. Amazing tales
are told of the "Wonderful Walker," schoolmaster
of Buttermere and curate of Seathwaite,
the Pastor of the "Excursion," but
his feats of economy might be challenged by
the old-time curate of Patterdale, who, on
an income of from sixty to ninety dollars a
year, lived comfortably, educated his four
children, and left them a tidy little fortune.
Such queer turns of fate were his that
he published his own banns and married his
father.</p>

<p>Most of those for whose sake the Lake
Country is holy ground lived a contemplative,
sequestered life akin to that of the mediæval
monks, the scholars and visionaries of a fighting
world; but Coniston, on the edge of
Lancashire, is the shrine of a warrior saint,
Ruskin, whose last earthly home, Brantwood,
looks out over Coniston Water, and whose
grave in the quiet churchyard, for which
Westminster Abbey was refused, is beautifully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
marked by a symbolically carven cross
quarried from the fine greenstone of Coniston
Fells. In the Ruskin Museum may be seen
many heart-moving memorials of that hero
life, all the way from the abstracts of sermons
written out for his mother in a laborious
childish hand to the purple pall, worked for
him by the local Linen Industry he so eagerly
founded, and embroidered with his own
words: "Unto This Last."</p>

<p>Not in any roll-call of the men of letters
who have trodden the Cumbrian Hills should
the poet Gray be forgotten. The first known
tourist in the Lake Country, he was delighted
with Grasmere and Keswick, but Borrowdale,
plunged deep amid what the earliest
guide-book, that of West in 1774, was to describe
as "the most horrid romantic mountains,"
turned him back in terror.</p>

<p>Yet Wordsworth, for all his illustrious compeers,
is still the presiding genius of these
opalescent hills and silver meres. It is to
him, that plain-faced man who used to go
"booing" his verses along these very roads,
that multitudes of visitants have owed</p>

<h3>I</h3>

<p>We heard about it first in Ambleside.
We were in lodgings half-way up the
hill that leads to the serene, forsaken
Church of St. Anne. It was there that
Faber, fresh from Oxford, had been curate,
silently thinking the thoughts that were to
send him into the Roman communion, and
his young ghost, with the bowed head and
the troubled eyes, was one of the friends we
had made in the few rainy days of our sojourn.
Another was Jock, a magnificent old
collie, who accepted homage as his royal due,
and would press his great head against the
knee of the alien with confident expectation
of a caress, lifting in recognition a long, comprehending
look of amber eyes. Another
friend&mdash;though our relations were sometimes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
strained&mdash;was Toby, a piebald pony
of piquant disposition. He allowed us to sit
in his pony-cart at picturesque spots and read
the Lake Poets to him, and to tug him up the
hills by his bridle, which he had expert ways
of rubbing off, to the joy of passing coach-loads,
when our attention was diverted to the
landscape. Another was our kindly landlady.
She came in with hot tea that Saturday
afternoon to cheer up the adventurous
member of the party, who had just returned
half drowned from a long drive on coachtop
for the sake of scenery absolutely blotted out
by the downpour. There the "trippers" had
sat for hours, huddled under trickling umbrellas,
while the conscientious coachman
put them off every now and then to clamber
down wet banks and gaze at waterfalls, or
halted for the due five minutes at a point
where nothing was perceptible but the grey
slant of the rain to assure them&mdash;and the
spattered red guidebook confirmed his statement&mdash;that
this was "the finest view in
Westmoreland." So when our landlady began
to tell us of the ancient ceremony which
the village was to observe that afternoon,
the bedrenched one, hugging the bright dot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
of a fire, grimly implied that the customs
and traditions of this sieve-skied island&mdash;in
five weeks we had had only two rainless
days&mdash;were nothing to her; but the tea,
that moral beverage which enables the English
to bear with their climate, wrought its
usual reformation.</p>

<p>At half-past five we were standing under
our overworked umbrellas on a muddy street
corner, waiting for the procession to come
by. And presently it came, looking very
much as if it had been through a pond to
gather the rushes. In front went a brass
band, splashing along the puddles to merry
music, and then a long train of draggled children,
with a few young men and maidens to
help on the toddlers, two or three of whom
had to be taken up and carried, flowers and
all. But soberly and sturdily, in the main,
that line of three hundred bonny bairns
trotted along through the heavy clay, under
the soft rain&mdash;little lads in rubber coats and
gaiters, some holding their tall bunches of
rushes, or elaborate floral designs, upright
before them like bayonets, some shouldering
them like guns; tired little lassies clasping
their "bearings" in their arms like dolls, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
dragging them along like kittens. All down
the line the small coats and cloaks were not
only damp, but greened and mossed and
petal-strewn from the resting and rubbing
of one another's burdens. These were of
divers sorts. Most effective were the slender
bundles of rushes,&mdash;long, straight rushes
gathered that morning from the meres by
men who went out in boats for the purpose.
These rush-fagots towered up from a distance
like green candles, making the line resemble
a procession of Catholic fairies. The
village, however, took chief pride in the moss-covered
standards of various device entwined
with rushes and flowers. There were harps of
reeds and waterlilies, crosses of ferns and harebells,
shepherds' crooks wound with heather,
sceptres, shields, anchors, crowns, swords,
stars, triangles, hearts, with all manner of
nosegays and garlands. Ling and bracken
from the hillsides, marigolds from the marsh,
spikes of oat and spears of wheat from the
harvest-fields, and countless bright-hued blossoms
from meadow and dooryard and garden
were woven together, with no little taste and
skill, in a pretty diversity of patterns.</p>

<p>The bells rang out blithe welcome as the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
procession neared the steepled Church of St.
Mary, where a committee of ladies and gentlemen
received the offerings and disposed
them, according to their merit, in chancel or
aisles. The little bearers were all seated in
the front pews, the pews of honour, before
we thronging adults, stacking our dripping
umbrellas in the porch, might enter. The
air was rich with mingled fragrances. Along
the chancel rail, in the window-seats, on the
pillars, everywhere, were rushes and flowers,
the choicest garden-roses whispering with
foxglove and daisy and the feathered timothy
grass. But sweeter than the blossoms were
the faces of the children, glad in their rustic
act of worship, well content with their own
weariness, no prouder than the smiling angels
would have had them be. Only here and
there a rosy visage was clouded with disappointment,
or twisted ruefully awry in the
effort to hold back the tears, for it must needs
be that a few devices, on which the childish
artists had spent such joyful labour, were assigned
by the expert committee to inconspicuous
corners. The mere weans behaved
surprisingly well, though evensong, a brief
and sympathetic service, was punctuated by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
little sobs, gleeful baby murmurs, and crows
of excitement. The vicar told the children,
in a few simple words, how, in earlier times,
when the church was unpaved, the earth-floor
was strewn with sweet-smelling rushes,
renewed every summer, and that the rushes
and flowers of to-day were brought in memory
of the past, and in gratitude for the beauty of
their home among the hills and lakes. Then
the fresh child voices rang out singing praises
to Him who made it all:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The purple-headed mountain,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The river running by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The sunset, and the morning<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That brightens up the sky."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>They sang, too, their special hymn written
for the Ambleside rush-bearers seventy years
ago, by the well-beloved vicar of Brathay, the
Rev. Owen Lloyd:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Our fathers to the house of God,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As yet a building rude,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bore offerings from the flowery sod,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And fragrant rushes strew'd.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<hr class="hrp" /><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"These, of the great Redeemer's grace<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bright emblems, here are seen;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He makes to smile the desert place<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With flowers and rushes green."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span></div></div>

<p>One highly important ceremony, to the
minds of the children, was yet to come,&mdash;the
presentation of the gingerbread. As they
filed out of the church, twopenny slabs of a
peculiarly black and solid substance were
given into their eager little hands. The rain
had ceased, and we grown-ups all waited in
the churchyard, looking down on the issuing
file of red tam-o'-shanters, ribboned straw
hats, worn grey caps, and, wavering along very
low in the line, soft, fair-tinted baby hoods,
often cuddled up against some guardian knee.
Under the varied headgear ecstatic feasting
had begun even in the church porch, though
some of the children were too entranced with
excitement to find their mouths. One chubby
urchin waved his piece of gingerbread in the
air, and another laid his on a gravestone and
inadvertently sat down on it. A bewildered
wee damsel in robin's-egg blue had lost hers
in the basket of wild flowers that was slung
about her neck. One spud of a boy, roaring
as he came, was wiping his eyes with his.
In general, however, the rush-bearers were
munching with such relish that they did not
trouble themselves to remove the tissue paper
adhering to the bottom of each cake,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
but swallowed that as contentedly as the rest.
Meanwhile their respective adults were swooping
down upon them, dabbing the smear of
gingerbread off cheeks and chins, buttoning up
little sacques and jackets, and whisking off the
most obtrusive patches of half-dried mud.
Among these parental regulators was a beaming
old woman with a big market-basket on her
arm, who brushed and tidied as impartially as
if she were grandmother to the whole parish.</p>

<p>Then, again, rang out those gleeful harmonies
of which our Puritan bells know nothing.
The circle of mountains, faintly flushed
with an atoning sunset, looked benignly down
on a spectacle familiar to them for hundreds
of Christian summer-tides; and if they remembered
it still longer ago, as a pagan rite
in honour of nature gods, they discreetly
kept their knowledge to themselves.</p>

<p>The rushes and flowers brightened the
church through the Sunday services, which
were well attended by both dalesfolk and
visitors. On Monday twelve prizes were
awarded, and the bearings were taken away
by their respective owners. Then followed
"the treat," an afternoon of frolic, with rain
only now and then, on a meadow behind St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
Mary's. The ice-cream cart, the climbing-pole,
swings and games, seemed to hold the
full attention of the children, to each of whom
was tied a cup; but when the simple supper
was brought on to higher ground close by the
church, who sat like a gentle mother in the
very midst of the merry-make, a jubilant,
universal shout, "It's coom! It's coom!"
sent all the small feet scampering toward the
goodies. To crown it all, the weather obligingly
gave opportunity, on the edge of the
evening, for fireworks, which even the poor little
Wesleyans outside the railing could enjoy.</p>

<h3>II</h3>

<p>The Ambleside rush-bearing takes place
on the Saturday before the last Sunday in
July. The more famous Grasmere rush-bearing
comes on the Saturday next after St.
Oswald's Day, August fifth. This year (1906)
these two festivals fell just one week apart.
The London papers were announcing that
it was "brilliant weather in the Lakes,"
which, in a sense, it was, for the gleams of
sunshine between the showers were like opening
doors of Paradise; yet we arrived at Grasmere<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
so wet that we paid our sixpences to
enter Dove Cottage, a shrine to which we had
already made due pilgrimage, and had a cosey
half-hour with Mrs. Dixon, well known to
the tourist world, before the fireplace whose
quiet glow often gladdened the poets and
dreamers of its great days gone by.</p>

<p>Our canny old hostess, in the bonnet and
shawl which seem to be her official wear, was
not disposed this afternoon to talk of the
Wordsworths, whom she had served in her
girlhood. Her mind was on the rush-bearing
for which she had baked the gingerbread
forty-three years. There were five hundred
squares this time, since, in addition to what
would be given to the children, provision
must be made for the Sunday afternoon teas
throughout Grasmere. The rolling out of the
dough had not grown easier with the passing of
nearly half a century, and she showed us the
swollen muscles of her wrist. Her little granddaughters,
their flower erections borne proudly
in their arms, were dressed all spick and span
for the procession, and stood with her, for their
pictures, at the entrance to Dove Cottage.</p>

<p>It was still early, and we strolled over to
the tranquil church beside the Rotha. Under<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
the benediction of that grey, embattled tower,
in the green churchyard with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Ridge rising gently by the side of ridge,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A heaving surface,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>sleep Wordsworth, his sister Dorothy, and
their kindred, while the names of Hartley
Coleridge and Arthur Hugh Clough may be
read on stones close by. We brought the
poets white heather and heart's ease for our
humble share in the rush-bearing.</p>

<p>Grasmere church, with its strange row of
rounded arches down the middle of the nave
and its curiously raftered roof, still wears the
features portrayed in <i>The Excursion</i>:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not raised in nice proportions was the pile,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But large and massy; for duration built;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With pillars crowded, and the roof upheld<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By naked rafters intricately crossed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like leafless underboughs, in some thick wood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All withered by the depths of shade above.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admonitory texts inscribed the walls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each in its ornamental scroll enclosed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each also crowned with wingèd heads&mdash;a pair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of rudely painted Cherubim. The floor<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of nave and aisle, in unpretending guise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was occupied by oaken benches ranged<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In seemly rows; the chancel only showed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some vain distinctions, marks of earthly state,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By immemorial privilege allowed."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span></div></div>

<p>There were a number of people in the
church, but the reverent hush was almost
unbroken. Strangers in the green churchyard
were moving softly about, reading
the inscriptions on stones and brasses, or
waiting in the pews, some in the attitude of
devotion. In the south aisle leaned against
the wall the banner of St. Oswald, a crimson-bordered
standard, with the figure of
the saint in white and crimson, worked
on a golden ground. A short, stout personage,
with grey chin-whiskers and a pompous
air, presumably the sexton, came in a
little after three with a great armful of fresh
rushes, and commenced to strew the floor.
Soon afterwards the children, with their
bearings, had taken their positions, ranged in
a long row on the broad churchyard wall,
fronting the street, which by this time was
crowded with spectators, for the Grasmere
rush-bearing is the most noted among the
few survivals of what was once, in the northern
counties of England, a very general
observance. There is an excellent account
of it, by an eyewitness, as early as
1789. James Clarke, in his <i>Survey of the
Lakes</i>, wrote:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<blockquote><p>"I happened once to be at Grasmere, at what they
call a Rushbearing.... About the latter end of
September a number of young women and girls
(generally the whole parish) go together to the tops
of the hills to gather rushes. These they carry to the
church, headed by one of the smartest girls in the company.
She who leads the procession is styled the
Queen, and carries in her hand a huge garland, and
the rest usually have nosegays. The Queen then goes
and places her garland upon the pulpit, where it remains
till after the next Sunday. The rest then strew
their rushes upon the bottom of the pews, and at the
church door they are met by a fiddler, who plays before
them to the public house, where the evening is
spent in all kinds of rustic merriment."</p></blockquote>

<p>Still more interesting is the record, in
Hone's <i>Year Book</i>, by "A Pedestrian." On
July 21, 1827, the walking tour of this witness
brought him to Grasmere.</p>

<blockquote><p>"The church door was open, and I discovered that
the villagers were strewing the floors with fresh rushes....
During the whole of this day I observed the children
busily employed in preparing garlands of such
wild flowers as the beautiful valley produces, for the
evening procession, which commenced at nine, in the
following order: The children, chiefly girls, holding
their garlands, paraded through the village, preceded
by the Union band. They then entered the church,
when the three largest garlands were placed on the
altar, and the remaining ones in various parts of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
place. In the procession I observed the 'Opium
Eater,' Mr. Barber, an opulent gentleman residing in
the neighbourhood, Mr. and Mrs. Wordsworth, Miss
Wordsworth and Miss Dora Wordsworth. Wordsworth
is the chief supporter of these rustic ceremonies.
The procession over, the party adjourned to the ballroom,
a hayloft at my worthy friend Mr. Bell's (now
the Red Lion), where the country lads and lasses
tripped it merrily and heavily. They called the
amusement dancing. I called it thumping; for he
who made the most noise seemed to be esteemed the
best dancer; and on the present occasion I think Mr.
Pooley, the schoolmaster, bore away the palm. Billy
Dawson, the fiddler, boasted to me of having been
the officiating minstrel at this ceremony for the last
six and forty years.... The dance was kept up to
a quarter of twelve, when a livery servant entered
and delivered the following verbal message to Billy:
'Master's respects, and will thank you to lend him
the fiddle-stick.' Billy took the hint, the Sabbath was
at hand, and the pastor of the parish (Sir Richard le
Fleming) had adopted this gentle mode of apprising
the assembled revellers that they ought to cease their
revelry. The servant departed with the fiddle-stick,
the chandelier was removed, and when the village clock
struck twelve not an individual was to be seen out of
doors in the village."</p></blockquote>

<p>Since then many notices of the Grasmere
rush-bearings have been printed, the most
illuminating being that of the Rev. Canon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
Rawnsley, 1890, now included in one of his
several collections of Lake Country sketches.
He calls attention to the presence, among the
bearings, of designs that suggest a Miracle
Play connection, as Moses in the bulrushes,
the serpent on a pole, and the harps of David
and Miriam,&mdash;emblems which were all in
glowing evidence this past summer. A merry
and sympathetic account is given in a ballad
of 1864, ascribed to Mr. Edward Button,
formerly the Grasmere schoolmaster:</p>

<p>The Grasmere rush-bearing, so far as we
saw it, was lacking in none of the traditional
features, not even the rain. Yet the
gently falling showers seemed all unheeded
by the line of bright-eyed children, steadfastly
propping up on the wall their various
tributes. Banners and crosses and crowns
were there, and all the customary emblems.
Among the several harps was one daintily
wrought of marguerites; two little images of
Moses reposed in arks woven of flags and
grasses; on a moss-covered lattice was traced
in lilies: "Consider the lilies of the field."
The serpent was made of tough green stems,
knotted and twisted together in a long coil
about a pole. Geranium, maiden-hair fern,
Sweet William, pansies, daisies, dahlias, asters,
fuchsias mingled their hues in delicate and
intricate devices. Among the decorated perambulators
was one all wreathed in heather,
with a screen of rushes rising high behind.
Its flower-faced baby was all but hidden under
a strewing of roses more beautiful than any
silken robe, and a wand twined with lilies of
the valley swayed unsteadily from his pink
fist. Six little maidens in white and green,
holding tall stalks of rushes, upheld the rush-bearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
sheet&mdash;linen spun at Grasmere and
woven at Keswick&mdash;crossed by blossoming
sprays.</p>

<p>The rush-cart, bearing the ribbon-tied
bunches of rushes, crowned with leafy oak-boughs
and hung with garlands, belonged
especially to Lancashire, where it has not
yet entirely disappeared; indeed a rush-cart
has been seen in recent years taking its way
through one of the most squalid quarters of
grimy Manchester; but the rush-sheet, on
which the precious articles of the parish,
silver tankards, teapots, cups, spoons, snuff-boxes,
all lent to grace this festival, were
arranged, had really gone out until, in this simplified
form, it was revived a few years ago at
Grasmere by lovers of the past. That the
sheet now holds only flowers is due to that
same inexorable logic of events which has
brought it about that no longer the whole
parish with cart-loads of rushes, no longer,
even, the strong lads and lasses swinging aloft
bunches of rushes and glistening holly boughs,
but only little children ranged in cherubic
row along the churchyard wall, and crowing
babies in their go-carts, bring to St. Oswald
the tribute of the summer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>It was from coach-top we caught our farewell
glimpse of the charming scene. The
village band, playing the Grasmere rush-bearing
march&mdash;an original tune believed to be
at least one hundred and fifty years old&mdash;led
the way, followed by the gold and crimson
banner of the warrior saint. The rush-sheet,
borne by the little queen and her maids of
honour, came after, and then the throng of
one hundred or more children, transforming
the street into a garden with the beauty and
sweetness of their bearings. As the procession
neared the church, the bells pealed out
"with all their voices," and we drove off under
a sudden pelt of rain, remembering Wordsworth's
reference to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"This day, when forth by rustic music led,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The village children, while the sky is red<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With evening lights, advance in long array<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Through the still churchyard, each with garland gay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, carried sceptre-like, o'ertops the head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the proud bearer."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our third rush-bearing we found in Cheshire,
on Sunday, August 12. A morning
train from Manchester brought us to Macclesfield&mdash;keeping
the Sabbath with its silk-mills
closed, and its steep streets nearly empty&mdash;in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
time for luncheon and a leisurely drive,
through occasional gusts of rain, four miles
to the east, up and up, into the old Macclesfield
Forest. This once wild woodland, infested
by savage boars, a lurking-place for
outlaws, is now open pasture, grazed over by
cows whose milk has helped to make the fame
of Cheshire cheese. But Forest Chapel still
maintains a rite which flourished when the
long since perished trees were sprouts and
saplings.</p>

<p>It is a tiny brown church, nested in a hollow
of the hills, twelve hundred feet above the
sea. In the moss-crowned porch, whose
arch was wreathed with flowers and grasses,
stood the vicar, as we came up, welcoming
the guests of the rush-bearing. For people
were panting up the hill in a continuous
stream, mill hands from Macclesfield and
farmer-folk from all the hamlets round. Perhaps
seven or eight hundred were gathered
there, hardly one-fourth of whom could find
room within the church.</p>

<p>We passed up the walk, thickly strewn with
rushes, under that brightly garlanded porch,
into a little sanctuary that was a very arbour
of greenery and blossom. As we were led up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
the aisle, our feet sank in a velvety depth of
rushes. The air was delicious with fresh,
woodsy scents. A cross of lilies rose from
the rush-tapestried font. The window-seats
were filled with bracken, fern, and goldenrod.
The pulpit and reading-desk were curtained
with long sprays of bloom held in green bands
of woven rushes. The chancel walls were
hidden by wind-swayed greens from which
shone out, here and there, clustering harebells,
cottage roses, and the golden glint of the
sunflower. The hanging lamps were gay
with asters, larkspur, and gorse. The whole
effect was indescribably joyous and rural,
frankly suggestive of festivity.</p>

<p>It was early evensong, a three o'clock service.
There was to be another at five. After
the ritual came the full-voiced singing of a
familiar hymn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Before the hills in order stood,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Or earth received her frame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From everlasting Thou art God,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To endless years the same.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<hr class="hrp" /><br />
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Time, like an ever-rolling stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bears all its sons away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They fly forgotten, as a dream<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Dies at the opening day."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></div></div>

<p>So singing, the little congregation filed out
into the churchyard, where the greater congregation,
unable to gain access, was singing
too. It was one of the rare hours of sunshine,
all the more blissful for their rarity. The
preacher of the day took his stand on a flat
tombstone. Little girls were lifted up to
seats upon the churchyard wall, and coats
were folded and laid across low monuments
for the comfort of the old people. A few
little boys, on their first emergence into the
sunshine, could not resist the temptation to
turn an unobtrusive somersault or so over the
more distant mounds, but they were promptly
beckoned back by their elders and squatted
submissively on the turf. The most of the
audience stood in decorous quiet. Two
generations back, gingerbread stalls and all
manner of booths would have been erected
about the church, and the rustics, clumping
up the steep path in the new boots which
every farmer was expected to give his men
for the rush-bearing, would have diversified
the services by drinking and wrestling.</p>

<p>But altogether still and sacred was the scene
on which we looked back as the compulsion
of the railway time-table drew us away;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
the low church tower keeping watch and
ward over that green enclosure of God's
acre, with the grey memorial crosses and
the throng of living worshippers,&mdash;a throng
that seemed so shadowy, so evanescent,
against the long memories of Forest Chapel
and the longer memories of those sunlit
hills that rejoiced on every side. A yellow
rick rose just behind the wall, the straws
blowing in the wind as if they wanted to
pull away and go to church with the rushes.
On the further side of the little temple there
towered a giant chestnut, a dome of shining
green that seemed to overspread and shelter
its Christian neighbour, as if in recognition of
some ancient kinship, some divine primeval
bond, attested, perhaps, by this very rite of
rush-bearing. The enfolding blue of the
sky, tender with soft sunshine, hallowed them
both.</p>

<h3>I. <span class="smcap">Lancashire</span></h3>

<p>We all know Liverpool,&mdash;but how
do we know it? The Landing
Stage, hotels whose surprisingly
stable floors, broad beds, and fresh foods are
grateful to the sea-worn, the inevitable bank,
perhaps the shops. Most of us arrive at Liverpool
only to hurry out of it,&mdash;to Chester,
to London, to the Lakes. Seldom do the
beguilements of the Head Boots prevail upon
the impatient American to visit the birthplaces
of its two queerly assorted lions, "Mr.
Gladstone and Mrs. 'Emans," of whom the
second would surely roar us "as gently as any
sucking dove." Yet we might give a passing
thought to these as well as to the high-hearted
James Martineau and to Hawthorne, our supreme
artist in romance, four of whose precious
years the country wasted in that "dusky
and stifled chamber" of Brunswick Street.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
And hours must be precious indeed to the visitor
who cannot spare even one for the Walker
Fine Art Gallery, where hangs Rossetti's great
painting of "Dante's Dream,"&mdash;the Florentine,
his young face yearning with awe and
grief, led by compassionate Love to the couch
of Beatrice, who lies death-pale amid the flush
of poppies.</p>

<p>But the individuality of Liverpool is in its
docks,&mdash;over six miles of serried basins hollowed
out of the bank of the broad Mersey,
one of the hardest-worked rivers in the world,&mdash;wet
docks and dry docks, walled and gated
and quayed. From the busiest point of all,
the Landing Stage, the mighty ocean liners
draw out with their throngs of wearied holiday-makers
and their wistful hordes of
emigrant home-seekers. And all along the
wharves stand merchantmen of infinite variety,
laden with iron and salt, with soap and sugar,
with earthenware and clay, with timber and
tobacco, with coal and grain, with silks and
woollens, and, above all, with cotton,&mdash;the
raw cotton sent in not only from our own
southern plantations, but from India and
Egypt as well, and the returning cargoes of
cloth spun and woven in "the cotton towns"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
of Lancashire. The life of Liverpool is commerce;
it is a city of warehouses and shops.
The wide sea-range and the ever-plying ferryboats
enable the merchant princes to reside
well out of the town. So luxurious is the lot
of these merchants deemed to be that Lancashire
has set in opposition the terms "a
Liverpool gentleman" and "a Manchester
man," while one of the ruder cotton towns,
Bolton, adds its contribution of "a Bolton
chap." This congestion of life in the great
port means an extreme of poverty as well as
of riches. The poor quarters of Liverpool
have been called "the worst slums in Christendom,"
yet a recent investigation has shown
that within a limited area, selected because
of its squalor and misery, over five thousand
pounds a year goes in drink. The families
that herd together by threes and fours in a
single dirty cellar, sleeping on straw and
shavings, nevertheless have money to spend
at "the pub,"&mdash;precisely the same flaring,
gilded ginshop to-day as when Hawthorne
saw and pitied its "sad revellers" half a
century ago.</p>

<span class="caption">THE QUADRANT, LIVERPOOL</span>
</div>

<p>While Liverpool has a sorry pre-eminence
for high death-rate and for records of vice and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
crime, Manchester, "the cinder-heap," may
fairly claim to excel in sheer dismalness. The
river Irwell, on which it stands, is so black
that the Manchester clerks, as the saying
goes, run down to it every morning and fill
their ink-pots. Not only Manchester, but all
the region for ten miles around, is one monster
cotton factory. The towns within this sooty
ring&mdash;tall-chimneyed Bolton; Bury, that has
been making cloth since the days of Henry
VIII; Middleton on the sable Irk; Rochdale,
whose beautiful river is forced to toil not
for cotton only, but for flannels and fustians
and friezes; bustling Oldham; Ashton-under-Lyme,
with its whirr of more than three
million spindles; Staley Bridge on the Tame;
Stockport in Cheshire; Salford, which practically
makes one town with Manchester; and
Manchester itself&mdash;all stand on a deep coal-field.
The miners may be seen, of a Sunday
afternoon, lounging at the street corners, or
engaged in their favourite sport of flying carrier
pigeons, as if the element of air had a peculiar
attraction for these human gnomes. If
the doves that they fly are white, it is by some
special grace, for smut lies thick on wall and
ledge, on the monotonous ranks of "workingmen's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
homes," on the costly public buildings,
on the elaborate groups of statuary. One's
heart aches for the sculptor whose dream is
hardly made pure in marble before it becomes
dingy and debased.</p>

<p>Beyond the borders of this magic coal-field,
above which some dark enchantment binds all
humanity in an intertwisted coil of spinning,
weaving, bleaching, printing, buying, selling
cotton, are various outlying collieries upon
which other manufacturing towns are built,&mdash;Warrington,
which at the time of our Revolution
supplied the Royal Navy with half
its sail-cloth; Wigan, whose tradition goes
back to King Arthur, but whose renown is
derived from its seam of cannel coal; calico
Chorley; Preston, of warlike history and still
the centre of determined strikes; and plenty
more.</p>

<p>The citizens of the cotton towns are proud
of their grimy bit of the globe, and with good
reason. "Rightly understood," said Disraeli,
"Manchester is as great a human exploit as
Athens." The swift industrial growth, the
vast business expansion of all this region, are
to be counted among the modern miracles of
progress, barren of beauty and joy as their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
present stage may seem to be. The heroes
held in memory here are plain workingmen
whose mechanical inventions resulted in the
English spinning-mill,&mdash;John Kay of Bury,
James Hargreaves of Blackburn, Samuel
Crompton of Bolton, and Sir Richard Arkwright,
a native of Preston, who began his
career as a barber's apprentice and won his
accolade by an energy of genius which virtually
created the cotton manufacture in Lancashire.
The battle legends are of angry
mobs and smashed machinery, of garrisoned
mills and secret experiments and inventors in
peril of their lives. The St. George of Lancashire
is George Stephenson, the sturdy
Scotchman, who in 1830 constructed that
pioneer railway between Liverpool and Manchester,&mdash;a
road which had to perform no
mean exploit in crossing the quaking bog of
Chat Moss. Fanny Kemble, when a girl of
twenty-one, had the ecstasy of a trial trip with
Stephenson himself. She tells with fairy-tale
glamour how "his tame dragon flew panting
along his iron pathway" at "its utmost speed,
thirty-four miles an hour, swifter than a bird
flies." Wonder of wonders, this "brave little
she-dragon" could "run with equal facility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
backwards or forwards." This trip took
place at the end of August, preliminary to the
final opening on September fifteenth, an occasion
whose triumph was marred by a fatal
mischance, in that a stray dragon ran over
a director who was innocently standing on the
track. For a patron saint of to-day, Manchester
need go no further than to the founder
of the Ancoats Brotherhood, Charles Rowley,
that cheery philanthropist reminding one
of Hawthorne's friend who brightened the
dreary visages he met "as if he had carried
a sunbeam in his hand"; for the disciples
of the Beautiful, the followers of the Golden
Rule, are full of courage even here among
what the poet Blake would designate as "dark
Satanic mills." From out the dirt and din,
shrieking engines, roaring furnaces, clattering
machinery, chimneys belching smoke by day
and flame by night, blithely rises the song of
their Holy War:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I will not cease from mental fight,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor shall my sword sleep in my hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till we have built Jerusalem<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In England's green and pleasant land."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But this, though the modern reality of
South Lancashire, is not what the tourist<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
goes out to see. From Liverpool to Furness
Abbey is his natural and joyful route. He
steams at full speed up this richest, most
prosperous, and well-nigh most unattractive
part of England; he has left the Mersey, the
county's southern boundary, far behind; he
crosses the Ribble, which flows through the
centre of Lancashire, and the Lune, which
enters it from Westmoreland on the north and
soon empties into Morecambe Bay. He has
come from a district close-set with factory
towns, scarred with mine shafts and slag
heaps, into the sweet quietude of an agricultural
and pastoral region. But still above
and beyond him is Furness, that northernmost
section of Lancashire lying between
Cumberland and Westmoreland and shut off
from the rest of the county by Morecambe
Bay and the treacherous Lancaster sands.
High Furness is a part of the Lake Country,
claiming for Lancashire not only Coniston
Lake but even one side of Windermere, which
lies on the Westmoreland border. Its Cumberland
boundary is the sonneted Duddon.
Low Furness, the peninsula at the south of
this isolated strip, has a wealth of mineral
deposits, especially iron. The town Barrow-in-Furness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
which in 1846 consisted of a single
hut, with one fishing-boat in the harbour, has
been converted, by the development of the
mines, into a place of much commercial consequence.
Yet the lover of poetry will visit
it, not for its steel works, figuring so tragically
in Mrs. Humphry Ward's "Helbeck of Bannisdale,"
nor for its shipbuilding yards and
boasted floating docks, nor for the paper
works which take in a tree at one end and
put it out as boxes of dainty stationery at
the other, but in order to reach, by a boat
from Peele Pier, Wordsworth's Peele Castle,
"standing here sublime,"&mdash;that old island
fortress which the poet's dream has glorified
with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The light that never was on sea or land."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But it is to Furness Abbey that the
throngs of sightseers come, and well they
may. Its melancholy grace is one of the
treasures of memory. It was thither that
Wordsworth as a schoolboy&mdash;for Hawkshead
is within the limits of Furness&mdash;would
sometimes ride with his fellows. The
"Prelude" holds the picture, as he saw it
over a century ago, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"the antique walls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of that large abbey, where within the Vale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Nightshade, to St. Mary's honour built,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stands yet a mouldering pile with fractured arch,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Belfry, and images, and living trees;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A holy scene! Along the smooth green turf<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our horses grazed. To more than inland peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Left by the west wind sweeping overhead<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From a tumultuous ocean, trees and towers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In that sequestered valley may be seen,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Both silent and both motionless alike;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such the deep shelter that is there, and such<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The safeguard for repose and quietness."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We lingered there for days, held by the
brooding spell of that most lovely ruin. Hour
upon hour we would wander about among
the noble fragments which Nature was so
tenderly comforting for the outrages of His
Rapacity Henry VIII. Harebells shone blue
from the top of the broken arch of the tall east
window, whose glass was long since shattered
and whose mullions were wrenched away.
Grasses and all manner of little green weeds
had climbed up to triforium and clerestory,
where they ran lightly along the crumbling
edges. Ivy tapestries were clinging to the
ragged stone surfaces. Thickets of nightshade
mantled the sunken tombs and altar
steps. Ferns nodded over the fretted canopies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
of the richly wrought choir stalls and
muffled the mouths of fierce old gargoyles,
still grinning defiance at Time. In the blue
overhead, which no roof shut from view, a
seagull would occasionally flash by with the
same strong flight that the eyes of the Vikings,
whose barrows once dotted the low islands of
this western coast, used to follow with sympathetic
gaze. Wrens have built their nests
in plundered niche and idle capital. The
rooks, arraying themselves in sombre semicircle
along some hollow chancel arch, cawed
reminiscent vespers. And little boys and girls
from Barrow, joyous mites of humanity not
yet smelted into the industrial mass, tried
leaping-matches from the stumps of mossy
pillars and ran races through nave and cloister.
The wooden clogs of these lively youngsters
have left their marks on prostrate slab and
effigy, even on "the stone abbot" and "the
cross-legged knight," much to the displeasure
of the custodian,&mdash;a man who so truly cares
for his abbey, the legal property of the Duke
of Devonshire, that he has purchased two of
the chief antiquarian works upon Furness
in order that he may thoroughly acquaint
himself with its history. It was he who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
told us that many of the empty stone coffins
had been carried away by the farmers
of the neighbourhood to serve as horse-troughs,
and that in their barn walls might
be seen here and there sculptured blocks
of red sandstone quite above the appreciation
of calves and heifers. He told how he
had shown "Professor Ruskin" about the
ruins, and how, at Ruskin's request, Mrs.
Severn had sent him from Brantwood seeds
of the Italian toad-flax to be planted here.
He lent us his well-thumbed folios, West's
"Antiquities of Furness" and "Beck's Annales
Furnessienses," so that, sitting under
the holly-shade in the Abbey Hotel garden,
with a "starry multitude of daisies" at our
feet, we could pore at our ease over that
strange story, a tale of greatness that is told,
and now, save for those lofty ribs and arches
so red against the verdure, nothing but a tale.
Our readings would be pleasurably interrupted
toward the close of the afternoon by the
advent of tea, brought to us in the garden, and
the simultaneous arrival of a self-invited robin.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not like a beggar is he come,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But enters as a looked-for guest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confiding in his ruddy breast."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></div></div>

<p>We tossed crumbs to him all the more gaily
for the fancy that his ancestors were among
the pensioners of the abbey in the day of its
supremacy. For the monks of Furness maintained
an honourable reputation for hospitality
from that mid-thirteenth-century beginning,
when the Grey Brothers from Normandy
first erected the grave, strong, simple walls of
their Benedictine foundation in this deep and
narrow vale, to the bitter end in 1537. Meanwhile
they had early discarded the grey habit
of the Benedictines for the white of the Cistercians,
and their abbot had become "lord
of the liberties of Furness," exercising an
almost regal sway in his peninsula, with power
of life and death, with armed forces at command,
and with one of the richest incomes of
the kingdom under his control. With wealth
had come luxury. The buildings, which
filled the whole breadth of the vale, had
forgotten their Cistercian austerity in a profusion
of ornament. Within "the strait enclosure,"
encompassing church and cloisters,
the little syndicate of white-vested monks not
only chanted and prayed, transcribed and
illuminated manuscripts, taught the children
of their tenants and entertained the stranger,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
but planned financial operations on a large
scale. For outside this, the holy wall, was
another, shutting in over threescore acres of
fertile land which the lay brothers, far exceeding
the clerical monks in number, kept well
tilled. Here were mill, granary, bakehouse,
malt-kiln, brewery, fish-pond; and beyond
stretched all Furness, where the abbey raised
its cattle, sheep and horses, made salt, smelted
its iron, and gathered its rents.</p>

<p>Few of the monastic establishments had
so much to lose, but Furness was surrendered
to the commissioners of Henry VIII with
seemingly no resistance. The Earl of Sussex
reported to his greedy master that he found
the Lord Abbot "of a very facile and ready
mynde," while the prior, who had been a
monk in that house for fifty years, was "decrepted
and aged." Yet it may be noted
that of the thirty-three monks whom Sussex
found in possession, only thirty signed the
deed of surrender. On the fate of the three
history is silent, save for a brief entry to the
effect that two were imprisoned in Lancaster
Castle. There is no record of their liberation.
The monks who made their submission
were granted small pensions. The abbot<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
received the rectory of Dalton, so near the
desecrated abbey that he might have heard,
to his torment, the crash of its falling towers.
But there is room to hope that in those cruel
dungeons of Lancaster two men died because
they would not cringe. We do not know, and
it was in vain we hunted through the moonlight
for the ghost of that mysterious thirty-third,
who, too, might have a gallant tale
to tell.</p>

<p>The region abounds in points of interest.
Romney, the painter, is buried in the churchyard
of Dalton, his native place. Beautiful
for situation is Conishead Priory, "the Paradise
of Furness," once a house of the Black
Canons and now a much-vaunted Hydropathic,
for, in the stately language of the
eighteenth-century antiquary, Thomas West,
"Æsculapius is seldom invited to Furness,
but Hygeia is more necessary than formerly."</p>

</div>

<p>Near the banks of the Duddon stands
Broughton Tower, with its legend of how the
manor, in possession of the family from time
immemorial, was lost by Sir Thomas Broughton&mdash;and
this was the way of it. In 1487
Lambert Simnel, claiming to be the son of the
murdered Clarence, sailed over from Ireland,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
where he had been crowned by the sister of
Richard III, to dispute the new throne of
Henry VII. Among his supporters were the
Earl of Lincoln, Lord Lovel of Oxfordshire,
and Lord Geraldine with an Irish force; but
it was the general of his two thousand Burgundian
mercenaries, "bold Martin Swart,"
who is credited with having given name to
Swarthmoor, where the invaders encamped.
Sir Thomas joined them with a small body
of retainers and, in the crushing defeat that
followed, was probably left dead upon the
field. But legend says that two of the English
leaders escaped,&mdash;Lord Lovel to his own
house in Oxfordshire, where he hid in a secret
chamber and perished there of hunger, and
Sir Thomas to his faithful tenantry, who for
years concealed him in their huts and sheep-folds,
and when he died, white-haired,
wrapped him in his own conquered banner,
and gave him a burial worthy of his race.</p>

<p>But our associations with Swarthmoor were
of peace and not of war. Our pilgrimage
thither was made for the sake of Mistress Fell
of Swarthmoor Hall and of George Fox, her
second husband, who established hard by
what is said to be the first meeting-house of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Friends in England. Quitting the train at
Lindal, a few miles above the abbey, we found
ourselves in the rich iron country, "the Peru
of Furness." It must be the reddest land
this side of sunset. Even the turnips and
potatoes, we were told, come red out of the
ground. I know that we tramped amazedly
on, over a red road, past red trees and buildings,
with a red stream running below, and
the uncanniest red men, red from cap to shoe,
rising like Satan's own from out the earth to
tramp along beside us. The road was deeply
hedged, airless and viewless, and we were
glad when we had left three miles of it behind,
though the village of Swarthmoor, at which
we had then arrived, proved to be one of those
incredibly squalid English villages that make
the heart sick. Between wide expanses of
sweet green pasture, all carefully walled in,
with strict warnings against trespass, ran two
or three long, parallel stone streets, swarming
with children and filthy beyond excuse. The
lambs had space and cleanliness about them,
soft turf to lie upon, pure air to breathe,
but the human babies crawled and tumbled
on that shamefully dirty pavement, along
which a reeking beer wagon was noisily jolting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
from "public" to "public." Farther
down our chosen street, which soon slipped
into a lane, there were tidier homes and more
sanitary conditions. Yet even Swarthmoor
Hall, the fine old Tudor mansion which rose
across the fields beyond, had a somewhat uninviting
aspect. There were broken panes
in the windows, and the cows had made the
dooryards too much their own. The present
proprietors, who, we were assured, value the
old place highly, and had refused repeated
offers for it from the Society of Friends,
rent it to a farmer. The housekeeper, not
without a little grumbling, admitted us, and
showed us about the spacious rooms with
their dark oak panelling, their richly carven
mantels, their windows that look seaward
over Morecambe Bay and inland to the Coniston
mountains. The hall which Judge Fell&mdash;that
wise and liberal man, tolerant beyond
his time&mdash;allowed the Friends to use for
their weekly meetings, is a room of goodly
proportions, with flagged floor and timbered
roof. In the dining-room window stands a
simple deal desk once belonging to George
Fox, but that upper door through which he
used to preach to the throng in orchard and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
meadow is now walled up. As we, departing,
looked back at the house, large, plain, three-storied,
covered with grey stucco, we noted
how right up on the chimney, in the alien
fellowship of the chimney-pots, flourished
a goodly green yew, sown by passing wind
or bird. The housekeeper, who had waxed
so gracious that she accompanied us for a few
steps on our way, said she had lived in Swarthmoor
thirty-four years and had always seen
the yew looking much as it did now, but that
an old man of the neighbourhood remembered
it in his boyhood as only finger-long.
It had never, so far as she could tell, been provided
by mortal hand with earth or water,
but grew by some inner grace, a housetop
sign and signal.</p>

<p>Many hallowed memories cluster about
that old Elizabethan mansion. It was in
1632 that Judge Fell brought thither his
bride, Margaret Askew, sixteen years his
junior. She was a descendant of Anne
Askew, who, a beautiful woman of twenty-four,
thoughtful and truthful, had been
burned as a heretic,&mdash;one of the closing
achievements of the reign of Henry VIII. "I
saw her," reports a bystander, "and must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
needs confess of Mistress Askew, now departed
to the Lord, that the day before her execution,
and the same day also, she had on an angel's
countenance, and a smiling face; though
when the hour of darkness came, she was so
racked that she could not stand, but was
holden up between two serjeants."</p>

<p>It was then that the Lord Chancellor&mdash;who
previously, when even the callous jailer
had refused to rack the delicate body further,
had thrown off his gown and worked the
torture-engine with his own hands&mdash;offered
her the king's pardon if she would recant,
receiving in reply only the quiet words, "I
came not hither to deny my Lord and
Master."</p>

<p>It is not easy for us who read to echo the
prayer of her who suffered:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lord, I Thee desyre,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For that they do to me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let them not taste the hyre<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of their inyquyte."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>No wonder that Margaret Fell, with such
a history in her heart, should have lent a
ready ear to the doctrines of the "Children
of Light," as the people dubbed them, the
"Friends of Truth," as they called themselves,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
the "Quakers," whose prime contention
was for liberty of conscience.</p>

<p>She had been married twenty years when
George Fox first appeared at Swarthmoor
Hall, where all manner of "lecturing ministers"
were hospitably entertained. Three
weeks later, Judge Fell, a grave man not
far from sixty, was met, as he was riding
home from circuit, by successive parties of
gentlemen, "a deal of the captains and
great ones of the country," who had come
out to tell him that his family were "all
bewitched." Home he came in wrath, but
his wife soothed him as good wives know
how,&mdash;had the nicest of dinners made ready,
and sat by him, chatting of this and that,
while he ate.</p>

<p>"At night," says her own account, "George
Fox arrived; and after supper, when my husband
was sitting in the parlour, I asked if he
might come in. My husband said yes. So
George walked into the room without any
compliment. The family all came in, and
presently he began to speak. He spoke very
excellently, as ever I heard him; and opened
Christ's and the Apostles' practices.... If
all England had been there, I thought they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
could not have denied the truth of these things.
And so my husband came to see clearly the
truth of what he spake."</p>

<p>The next First-day the meeting of the
Friends was held at Swarthmoor Hall on
Judge Fell's own invitation, though he himself
went, as usual, to "the Steeplehouse."
The spirit of persecution was soon abroad,
and one day, when the Judge was absent on
circuit, Fox, while speaking in the church,
was set upon, knocked down, trampled,
beaten, and finally whipped out of town. On
Judge Fell's return, he dealt with the Friend's
assailants as common rioters. The Judge
held, however, his mother's faith to the end,
never becoming a member of the Society.
He died in the year of Cromwell's death,
1658, and was buried by torchlight under the
family pew in Ulverston church. "He was
a merciful man to God's people," wrote his
widow, adding that, though not a Friend, he
"sought after God in the best way that was
made known to him."</p>

<p>Meanwhile Margaret Fell had become a
leader among the Children of Light. Twice
she wrote to Cromwell in behalf of their cause,
and again and again to Charles II, with whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
she pleaded face to face. Now that her husband's
protection was withdrawn, persecution
no longer spared her, and she, like Fox
and many another of the Society, came to
know well the damp and chilly dungeons
of Lancaster Castle,&mdash;that stern prison of
North Lancashire which may be viewed afar
off from the ominous height of Weeping Hill.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thousands, as toward yon old Lancastrian Towers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A prison's crown, along this way they passed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lingering durance or quick death with shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From this bare eminence thereon have cast<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Their first look&mdash;blinded as tears fell in showers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shed on their chains."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Refusing, as a Quaker must needs refuse,
to take the oath of supremacy, Mistress Fell
stood her trial in 1663, her four daughters
beside her. Her arguments irritated the
judge into exclaiming that she had "an everlasting
tongue," and he condemned her to
imprisonment for life, with confiscation of all
her property to the Crown. But after some
five years of Lancaster's grim hospitality
she was released, and forthwith set out on a
series of visits to those English jails in which
Quakers were immured. It was not until
eleven years after Judge Fell's death that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
married George Fox. The courtship is summarised
in Fox's "Journal": "I had seen
from the Lord a considerable time before that
I should take Margaret Fell to be my wife;
and when I first mentioned it to her she felt
the answer from God thereto." Yet after
the marriage, as before, they pursued, in the
main, their separate paths of preaching,
journeying, and imprisonment. It was seven
years before illness brought Fox to Swarthmoor,
which had been restored to the family,
for a brief rest. About a quarter of a mile
from the mansion, stood a dwelling-house in
its three or four acres of land. This modest
estate Fox purchased and gave it "to the
Lord, for the service of his sons and daughters
and servants called Quakers.... And also
my ebony bedstead, with painted curtains,
and the great elbow-chair that Robert Widder
sent me, and my great sea case with the bottles
in it I do give to stand in the house as heirlooms,
when the house shall be made use of
as a meeting-place, that Friends may have
a bed to lie on, a chair to sit on, and a bottle
to hold a little water for drink." He adds:
"Slate it and pave the way to it and about it,
that Friends may go dry to their meeting.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
You may let any poor, honest Friend live in
the house, and so let it be for the Lord's service,
to the end of the world."</p>

<p>A deep hawthorn lane, winding to the
left, led us to that apostolic meeting-house,
well-nigh hidden from the road by its high,
grey, ivy-topped wall. We passed through
a grassy outer court into an inner enclosure
thick-set with larches, hollies, and wild cherry.
The paths are paved. Luxuriant ivy curtains
porch and wall, and clambers up over the low
tower. Above the door is inscribed:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Ex dono G. F.</i>, 1682.</p>

<p>The meeting-room within is of Quaker plainness,
with drab-tinted walls. The settees
are hard and narrow, though a few "at the
top" are allowed the creature comforts of
cushions. Only the posts are left of the ebony
bedstead, but two elbow-chairs of carven oak,
a curiously capacious and substantial travelling-chest,
and a Bible still are shown as Fox's
personal belongings. The Bible is a black-letter
folio of 1541, the Treacle Bible, open
at the third chapter of Jeremiah, where, in
the last verse, comes the query: "Is not there
any tryacle in Gylyad?"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>But Lancashire has other saints no less
holy than those dear to Protestant and
Quaker memory. Surely martyrs, irrespective
of the special phase of the divine idea
for which they gladly give up their bodies
to torture and to death, are the truest heroes
of history.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For a tear is an intellectual thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a sigh is the sword of an Angel King,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bitter groan of the Martyr's woe<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is an arrow from the Almighty's bow."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>This remote county, especially the north
with its perilous bogs and rugged fells, clung
to the mother faith. Many of its old families
are still Catholic; many a Tudor mansion
can show its "priest-hole" from which, perhaps,
some hidden Jesuit has been dragged
to the dungeon or the scaffold. We journeyed
up from Manchester on a sunny afternoon,
for love of one of these, to the beautiful
valley of the Ribble, rich in manifold traditions.
Our time was short, but we climbed
to the keep of Clitheroe Castle, ruined for its
loyalty to Charles I, and viewed that wide
prospect whose most impressive feature is the
witch-storied stretch of Pendle Hill. On
that long level range the famous witches of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
Lancashire used to hold their unseemly orgies,
hooting and yowling about Malkin Tower,
their capital stronghold, whose evil stones
were long since cast down and scattered.
Peevish neighbours they were, at the best,
ready on the least provocation to curse the cow
from giving milk and the butter from coming
in the churn, but on Pendle Hill the broomstick
battalion was believed to dance in uncouth
circle about caldrons seething with
hideous ingredients and to mould little wax
images of their enemies who would peak and
pine as these effigies wasted before the flames,
or shudder with fierce shoots of agony as red-hot
needles were run into the wax. What
were honest folk to do? It was bad enough
to have the bride-cake snatched away from
the wedding-feast and to find your staid
Dobbin all in a lather and dead lame at sunrise
from his wild gallop, under one of these
"secret, black and midnight hags," to Malkin
Tower, but when you were saddled and bridled
and ridden yourself, when the hare that you
had chased and wounded turned suddenly
into your own wife panting and covered with
blood, when your baby was stolen from the
cradle to be served up in the Devil's Sacrament<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
of the Witches' Sabbath, it was time to
send for one of King James's "witch-finders."
So the poor old crones, doubled up and corded
thumb to toe, were flung into the Calder to
see whether they would sink or swim, or sent
to where the fagot-piles awaited them in the
courtyard of Lancaster Gaol, or even&mdash;so
the whisper goes&mdash;flung into their own lurid
bonfires on Pendle Hill. But still strange
shadows, as of furious old arms that scatter
curses, are to be seen on those heather-purpled
slopes, and from the summit black thunderstorms
crash down with supernatural suddenness
and passion.</p>

<p>Our driver was a subdued old man, with
an air of chronic discouragement. He met
the simplest questions, about trains, about
trees, about climate, with a helpless shake of
the head and the humble iteration: "I can't
say. I'm no scholard. I never went to
school. I can't read." He eyed Pendle Hill,
standing blue in a flood of sunshine, with obvious
uneasiness, and asked if we thought
there really were "such folk as witches." As
we drove up the long avenues of Stonyhurst,
our goal, that imposing seat of learning seemed
to deepen his meek despondency. He murmured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
on his lofty perch: "I never went to
school."</p>

<p>Stonyhurst, the chief Catholic college of
England, was originally located at St. Omer's
in France. Over sea to St. Omer's the
Catholic gentry of Elizabethan times used
to send their sons. There the exiled lads
vainly chanted litanies for England's conversion,
their church door bearing in golden
letters the fervent prayer: "<i>Jesu, Jesu, converte
Angliam, fiat, fiat.</i>" The Elizabethan
sonneteer, William Habington, who describes
"a holy man" as one who erects religion on
the Catholic foundation, "knowing it a ruinous
madness to build in the air of a private
spirit, or on the sands of any new schism,"
was a St. Omer's boy. Nineteen of those
quaintly uniformed lads, blue-coated, red-vested,
leather-trousered, afterwards died on
the scaffold or in prison, usually as Jesuit
priests who had slipped into England against
Elizabethan law.</p>

<p>During the latter half of the eighteenth
century, when the strong feeling against the
Jesuits led to their banishment from France
and finally to the temporary suppression of
the order, the school began its wanderings,&mdash;from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
St. Omer's to Bruges, thence to Liège,
and at last, in 1794, from Liège to England,
where one of the alumni presented the homeless
seminary with the fine estate of Stonyhurst.
In this secluded, healthful situation
there now stands a prosperous college, with
dormitories for two hundred students, with
well-equipped academic buildings, a preparatory
school, and a great farm which of itself
maintains the institution.</p>

<p>Stonyhurst has many treasures,&mdash;illuminated
missals, Caxton editions, a St. John's
Gospel in Gaelic script said to have been
found in the tomb of St. Cuthbert, relics
of "Blessed Thomas More," original portraits
of the Stuarts,&mdash;including the winsome
picture of Bonny Prince Charlie as a child,&mdash;but
the object of our quest was a little manuscript
volume of Robert Southwell's poems.
Of course the porter knew nothing about it,
though he strove to impart the impression
that this was the only matter in the universe
on which he was uninformed, and "the teaching
fathers" were still absent for their summer
holiday; but a gentle old lay brother finally
hunted out for us the precious book, choicely
bound in vellum and delicately written in an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
unknown hand, with corrections and insertions
in the young priest's own autograph.
This Stonyhurst manuscript gives the best
and only complete text for the strange, touching,
deeply devotional poems of Father Southwell,&mdash;the
text on which Grosart's edition
rests. It is supposed that they were written
out for him by a friend while he lay a prisoner
in the Tower, and that in the intervals between
the brutalities of torture to which that
most sensitive organism was again and again
subjected, he put to his book these finishing
touches,&mdash;only a few months and weeks
before he was executed at Tyburn by a blunderer
who adjusted the noose so badly that
the martyr "several times made the sign of
the Cross while he was hanging."</p>

<p>Our eyes filled as we deciphered the faded
Elizabethan script:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God's spice I was, and pounding was my due;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In fading breath my incense savored best;<br /></span>

<span class="i2">The cheynes unloos'd to let the captive goe."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></div></div>

<p>As we were driving on to Whalley, to pay
our tribute of honour to yet one shining
memory more, the summit of Pendle Hill
suddenly wrapped itself in sable cloud, and
its haunting vixens let loose upon us the most
vehement pelt of rain, diversified with lightning-jags
and thunder-crashes, that it was
ever my fortune to be drenched withal. One
of the Lancashire witches is buried in Whalley
churchyard under a massive slab which is
said to heave occasionally. I think I saw
it shaking with malicious glee as we came
spattering up the flooded path, looking as if
we had ourselves been "swum" in the Calder.</p>

<p>Whalley church, one of the most curious
and venerable parish churches of England,
shelters the ashes of John Paslew, last Abbot
of Whalley. Upon the simple stone are cut
a floriated cross and chalice, with the words
"<i>Jesu fili dei miserere mei</i>." Only the fewest
traces, chief of which is a beautiful gateway
with groined roof, remain of this great
abbey, one of the richest in the north of England,
charitable, hospitable, with an especially
warm welcome for wandering minstrels. Its
walls have been literally levelled to the ground,
like those of the rival Cistercian foundation at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Sawley, a few miles above. But the "White
Church under the Leigh," believed to have
been originally established by the missionary
Paulinus in the seventh century, preserves
the abbey choir stalls, whose crocketed pinnacles
tower to the top of the chancel. Their
<i>misereres</i> are full of humour and spirit. An
old woman beating her husband with a ladle
is one of the domestic scenes that tickled the
merry monks of Whalley. We could have
lingered long in this ancient church for its
wealth of fine oak carving, its pew fashioned
like a cage, its heraldic glass, and, in the
churchyard, the three old, old crosses with
their interlacing Runic scrolls, one of which,
when a witch read it backward, would do her
the often very convenient service of making
her invisible. But we had time only for the
thought of Abbot Paslew, who, refusing to
bow to the storm like the Abbot of Furness,
had raised a large body of men and gone to
arms for the defence of the English monasteries
against the royal robber. He was a
leader in the revolt of 1537, known as the Pilgrimage
of Grace. The Abbot of Sawley,
William Trafford, old jealousies forgotten,
took the field with him. But monks were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
no match for Henry VIII's generals, the rebellion
was promptly crushed, the Abbot of
Sawley was hanged at Lancaster, and Abbot
Paslew was taken, with a refinement of vengeance,
back to Whalley and gibbeted there,
in view of the beautiful abbey over which he
had borne sway for thirty years. The country
folk had depended upon it for alms, for
medical aid, for practical counsel, for spiritual
direction, and we may well believe that, as
they looked on at the execution, their hearts
were hot against the murderers of him
who, when he grasped the sword, had assumed
the title of Earl of Poverty. The
mound where he suffered is well remembered
to this day.</p>

<p>The flying hours had been crowded with
impressions, tragic, uncanny, pitiful, and we
had yet, in going to the station, to run the
gantlet of a tipsy town, for it was a holiday.
We had found Clitheroe drinking, earlier in
the afternoon, and now we found Whalley
drunk. One unsteady individual, wagging
his head from side to side and stretching out
a pair of wavering arms, tried to bar my
progress.</p>

<p>"Wh-where be g-goin'?" he asked.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>"To the train," I answered curtly, dodging
by.</p>

<p>He sat down on the wall and wept aloud.</p>

<p>"T-to the tr-train! Oh, the L-Lord
bl-bless you! The g-good L-Lord bl-bless
you all the w-way!"</p>

<p>And the last we saw and heard of him, he
was still feebly shaking his hands after us
and sobbing maudlin benedictions.</p>


<h3>II. <span class="smcap">Cheshire</span></h3>

<p>Drayton the poet once took it upon him
to assure Cheshire that what was true of
Lancashire was true also of her:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Thy natural sister shee&mdash;and linkt unto thee so<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Lancashire along with Cheshire still doth goe."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>From that great backbone of England, the
Pennine Range, both these counties fall away
to the west, but Cheshire quickly opens into
the Shropshire plain. At the northeast it has
its share in the treasures of the deep coal-field
rent across by the Pennines, and here,
too, are valuable beds of copper. In this
section of the county cluster the silk towns,
among them Macclesfield, the chief seat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
England of this manufacture, and Congleton,
whose character we will trust has grown
more spiritual with time. For in 1617 one
of the village wags tugged a bear into the
pulpit at the hour of service, and it was a full
twelvemonth before the church was reconsecrated
and worship resumed. Indeed, the
Congleton folk had such a liking for bear-baiting
or bear-dancing, or whatever sport it
was their town bear afforded them, that when
a few years later this poor beast died, it is
told that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"living far from Godly fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They sold the Church Bible to buy a bear."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The old Cheshire, everywhere in evidence
with its timber-and-plaster houses, distracts
the mind from this new industrial Cheshire.
We visited Macclesfield, but I forgot its factories,
its ribbons and sarcenets, silks and
satins and velvets, because of the valiant
Leghs. Two of them sleep in the old Church
of St. Michael, under a brass that states in
a stanza ending as abruptly as human life
itself:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here lyeth the body of Perkin a Legh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That for King Richard the death did die,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Betray'd for righteousness;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the bones of Sir Peers his sone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That with King Henrie the fift did wonne<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In Paris."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>I have read that Sir Perkin was knighted
at Crecy and Sir Peers at Agincourt, and that
they were kinsmen of Sir Uryan Legh of Adlington,
the Spanish Lady's Love.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Will ye hear a Spanish Lady,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>This Sir Uryan was knighted by Essex at
the siege of Calais, and it was then, apparently,
that the poor Spanish lady, beautiful
and of high degree, lost her heart. The
Elizabethan ballad, whose wood-cut shows
a voluminously skirted dame entreating an
offish personage in a severely starched ruff,
tells us that she had fallen, by some chance
of war, into his custody.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span></div></div>

<p>But freedom was no boon to her.</p>

<p>In vain he urges that he is the enemy of her
country.</p>

<p>This ballad, which Shakespeare might
have bought for a penny "at the Looking-glass
on London bridge" and sung to the
tune of "Flying Fame," is still a favourite
throughout Cheshire.</p>

<p>But we are driving from Macclesfield up
into the Cheshire highlands,&mdash;velvety hills,
green to the top, all smoothed off as trim as
sofa-cushions and adorned with ruffles of foliage.
Nature is a neat housekeeper even here
in the wildest corner of Cheshire. What was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
once savage forest is now tranquil grazing-ground,
and the walls that cross the slopes
and summits, dividing the sward into separate
cattle-ranges, run in tidy parallels. But most
of the county is flat,&mdash;so flat that it all can
be viewed from Alderly Edge, a cliff six hundred
and fifty feet high, a little to the west of
Macclesfield. Along the Mersey, the Lancastrian
boundary, rise the clustered chimneys
of Cheshire's cotton towns. Yet cotton is
not the only industry of this northern strip.
The neighbourhood of Manchester makes
market-gardening profitable; potatoes and
onions flourish amain; and Altrincham, a
pleasant little place where many of the Manchester
mill-owners reside, proudly contributes
to their felicity its famous specialty of the
"green-top carrot."</p>

<p>I suppose these cotton-lords only smile disdainfully
at the tales of the old wizard who
keeps nine hundred and ninety-nine armed
steeds in the deep caverns of Alderly Edge,
waiting for war. What is his wizardry to
theirs! But I wonder if any of them are
earning a sweeter epitaph than the one which
may be read in Alderly Church to a rector,
Edward Shipton, M.A.,&mdash;it might grieve his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
gentle ghost, should we omit those letters,&mdash;who
died in 1630:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here lies below an aged sheep-heard clad in heavy clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those stubborne weedes which come not of unto the judgment day.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whilom hee led and fed with welcome paine his careful sheepe,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did not feare the mountaines' highest tops, nor vallies deep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That he might save from hurte his fearful flocks, which were his care.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To make them strong he lost his strengthe, and fasted for their fare.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How they might feed, and grow, and prosper, he did daily tell,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then having shew'd them how to feed, he bade them all farewell."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Good men have come out of Cheshire. In
the Rectory House of Alderly was born Dean
Stanley. Bishop Heber is a Cheshire worthy,
as are the old chroniclers, Higden and Holinshead.
Even the phraseology of Cheshire
wills I have fancied peculiarly devout, as, for
instance, Matthew Legh's, in 1512:</p>

<blockquote><p>"<i>Imprimis</i>, I bequeath my sole to almightie god and
to his blessed moder seynt Mary, and to all the selestiall
company in heaven, and my bodi to be buried in the
Chappell of Seynt Anne within the parish Church of
Handley or there where it shall please almightie god to
call for me at his pleasure."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span></p>

<p>The men of Cheshire have on occasion,
and conspicuously during the Civil War, approved
themselves for valour. When the
royalist garrison of Beeston Castle, the "other
hill" of this pancake county, was at last forced
to accept terms from the Roundhead troops,
there was "neither meat nor drink found in
the Castle, but only a piece of a turkey pie,
two biscuits, and a live pea-cock and pea-hen."</p>

<p>Yet Cheshire is famed rather for the virtues
of peace,&mdash;for thrift, civility, and neighbourly
kindness. An early-seventeenth-century
"Treatise on Cheshire" says: "The
people of the country are of a nature very
gentle and courteous, ready to help and further
one another; and that is to be seen
chiefly in the harvest time, how careful are
they of one another." A few years later, in
1616, a native of the county wrote of it not
only as producing "the best cheese of all
Europe," but as blessed with women "very
friendly and loving, painful in labour, and in
all other kind of housewifery expert."</p>

<p>The accepted chronicler of Cheshire womanhood,
however, is Mrs. Gaskell. As we lingered
along the pleasant streets of Knutsford&mdash;her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
Cranford&mdash;and went in and out of
the quiet shops, we blessed her memory for
having so delectably distilled the lavender
essences of that sweet, old-fashioned village
life. She had known it and loved it all the
way from her motherless babyhood, and she
wrote of it with a tender humour that has
endeared it to thousands. Our first Knutsford
pilgrimage was to her grave beside the
old Unitarian chapel, for both her father and
her husband were clergymen of that faith.
We had seen in Manchester&mdash;her Drumble&mdash;the
chapel where Mr. Gaskell ministered,
and had read her "Mary Barton," that sympathetic
presentation of the life of Lancashire
mill-hands which awoke the anger and perhaps
the consciences of the manufacturers.
She served the poor of Manchester not with
her pen alone, but when our war brought
in its train the cotton famine of 1862-63, she
came effectively to their relief by organizing
sewing-rooms and other means of employment
for women. Husband and wife, fulfilled
of good works, now rest together in that
sloping little churchyard which we trod with
reverent feet.</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Knutsford is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
becoming villaized. It has even suffered the
erection, in memory of Mrs. Gaskell, of an
ornate Italian tower, which Deborah certainly
would not have approved. It was not
May-day, so we could not witness the Knutsford
revival of the May-queen court, and we
looked in vain for the Knutsford wedding
sand. On those very rare occasions when
a bridegroom can be found, the kith and kin
of the happy pair make a welcoming path for
Hymen by trickling coloured sands through
a funnel so as to form a pavement decoration
of hearts, doves, true-love knots, and the like,
each artist in front of his own house. But
no minor disappointments could break the
Cranford spell, which still held us as we drove
out into the surrounding country. How
sunny and serene! With what awe we
passed the timbered mansions of the county
families! What green hedgerows! What
golden harvest-fields! What pink roses
clambering to the cottage-thatch! What
gardens, and what pastures on pastures,
grazed over by sleek kine that called to mind
Miss Matty's whimsical old lover and his
"six and twenty cows, named after the different
letters of the alphabet."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>Here in central Cheshire we ought not to
have been intent on scenery, but on salt, for
of this, as of silk, our smiling county has
almost a monopoly. And only too soon the
blue day was darkened by the smoke of Northwich,
the principal seat of the salt trade and
quite the dirtiest town in the county. The
valley of the Weaver, the river that crosses
Cheshire about midway between its northern
boundary, the Mersey, and its southern, the
Dee, has the richest salt-mines and brine-springs
of England. The salt towns, whose
chimneys belch blackness at intervals along
the course of the stream, are seen at their best,
or worst, in Northwich, though Nantwich, an
ancient centre of this industry, has charming
traditions of the village hymn that used to
be sung about the flower-crowned pits, especially
the "Old Brine," on Ascension Day,
in thanksgiving for the salt. We tried to take
due note of railways and canals, docks and
foundries, and the queer unevenness of the
soil caused by the mining and the pumping
up of brine,&mdash;such an uncertain site that
the houses, though bolted, screwed, and buttressed,
continually sag and sink. The mines
themselves are on the outskirts of the town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and we looked at the ugly sheds and scaffoldings
above ground, and did our best to imagine
the strange white galleries and gleaming pillars
below. There was no time to go down because
it had taken our leisurely Knutsford
coachman till ten o'clock to get his "bit of
breakfast." Dear Miss Matty would have
been gentle with him, and so we strove not to
glower at his unbending back, but to gather
in what we could, as he drove us to the train,
of the beauties by the way.</p>

<p>We left the salt to the care of the Weaver,
which was duly bearing it on, white blocks,
ruddy lumps, rock-salt and table-salt, to Runcorn
and to Liverpool. We put the brine-pits
out of mind, and enjoyed the lovely fresh-water
meres, social resorts of the most amiable
of ducks and the most dignified of geese,
which dot the Cheshire landscape. We had
visited Rostherne Mere on our way out, and
caught a glint from the fallen church-bell
which a Mermaid rings over those dim waters
every Easter dawn. We paused at Lower
Peover for a glimpse of its black-and-white
timbered church, deeply impressive and
almost unique as an architectural survival.
Among its curiosities we saw a chest hollowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
out of solid oak with an inscription to the
effect that any girl who can raise the lid with
one arm is strong enough to be a Cheshire
farmer's wife. Sturdy arms they needs must
have, these Cheshire women, for the valley
of the Weaver, like the more southerly Vale
of Dee, is largely given up to dairy farms and
to the production of cheeses. A popular song
betrays the county pride:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A Cheshire man went o'er to Spain<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To trade in merchandise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when arrived across the main<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"The Cheshire man soon sought the hold,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>But the best songs of Cheshire go to the
music of the river Dee. We have all had our
moments of envying its heart-free Miller.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>reports too truly the perils of that wide estuary
where Lycidas was lost. On the corresponding
estuary of the Mersey stands Birkenhead,
the bustling modern port of Cheshire;
but it was at Chester that Milton's college
mate had embarked for another haven than
the one he reached.</p>

<p>Chester itself is to many an American
tourist the old-world city first seen and best
remembered. Liverpool and Birkenhead are
of to-day, but Chester, walled, turreted, with
its arched gateways, its timber-and-plaster
houses, its gables and lattices, its quaint Rows,
its cathedral, is the mediæval made actual.
The city abounds in memories of Romans,
Britons, Saxons, of King Alfred who drove<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
out the Danes, of King Edgar who, "toucht
with imperious affection of glory," compelled
six subject kings to row him up the Dee to
St. John's Church, of King Charles who stood
with the Mayor on the leads of the wall-tower
now called by his name and beheld the defeat
of the royal army on Rowton Moor. As we
walked around the walls,&mdash;where, as everywhere
in the county, the camera sought in
vain for a Cheshire cat,&mdash;we talked of the
brave old city's "strange, eventful history,"
but if it had been in the power of a wish to
recall any one hour of all its past, I would
have chosen mine out of some long-faded
Whitsuntide, that I might see a Miracle
pageant in its mediæval sincerity,&mdash;the tanners
playing the tragedy of Lucifer's fall,
perhaps, or the water-carriers the comedy of
Noah's flood.</p>


<h3>III. <span class="smcap">Staffordshire</span></h3>

<p>This is the Black Country <i>par excellence</i>,&mdash;a
county whose heraldic blazon should be the
pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire
by night. It belongs to the central plain of
England, save on the northeast, where the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
lower end of the Pennine chain breaks into
picturesque highlands. Its gently undulating
reaches are still largely given over to agriculture,
but the bulk of its population, the most
of its energy and wealth, are concentrated in
the manufacturing towns that so thickly stud
the surface over its two coal-fields. The
northern is the last of that long line of coal-measures
running down from Lancashire;
the southern is much larger, though not so
workable, and extends across all South Staffordshire.
Both north and south, iron in
rich quantities is found with the coal, so that
for many years Staffordshire controlled the
iron trade of the world. Of late, South
Wales and other regions are successfully disputing
its supremacy.</p>

<p>We had, in previous visits to England,
crossed Staffordshire several times by train,
and memory retained an unattractive impression
of netted railways, forests of factory chimneys,
and grimy miners sweethearting with
rough pitgirls under smoke and cinders. If we
must enter it now, the occasion seemed propitious
for a trial of the automobile,&mdash;a mode of
conveyance which we had deemed too sacrilegious
for the Border and the Lake Country.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>Toward ten o'clock on an August morning&mdash;for
the chauffeur, like our Cheshire coachman,
could not be hurried over his "bit of
breakfast"&mdash;we tucked ourselves and a confiding
Shrewsbury lady into a snug motor-car,
and away we sped through northeastern
Shropshire across the county line. In a gasp
or two the name Eccleshall glimmered
through the dust that flew against our goggles.
This little town has one of the finest churches
in the county, but the frenzy of speed was on
us, and we tore by. Suddenly we came upon
the Trent, winding along, at what struck
us as a contemptibly sluggish pace, down
Staffordshire on its circuitous route to the
Humber. We tooted our horn and honked
up its western side to the Potteries. Here
the machine suffered an attack of cramps,
and while it was groaning and running around
in a circle and pawing the air, we had our
first opportunity to look about us.</p>

<p>The region known as the Potteries, the
chief seat of the earthenware manufactures
of England, consists of a strip of densely
populated land in this upper basin of the
Trent, a strip some ten miles long by two
miles broad, whose serried towns and villages<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
give the aspect of one continuous street.
Within this narrow district are over three
hundred potteries, whose employees number
nearly forty thousand, apart from the accessory
industries of clay-grinding, bone-grinding,
flint-grinding, and the like. It draws
on its own beds of coal and iron, but the china-clay
comes from Cornwall by way of Runcorn
and the Grand Trunk Canal, while for flints
it depends on the south coast of England and
on France. Genius here is named Josiah
Wedgwood. This inventor of fine porcelains,
whose "Queen's ware" gained him
the title of "Queen's Potter," was born in
1759 at Burslem, which had been making
brown butter-pots as far back as the days of
Charles I. When Burslem grew too small
for his enterprise, Wedgwood established the
pottery village of Etruria, to which the automobile
passionately refused to take us. It
dashed us into Newcastle-under-Lyme, where
we did not particularly want to go, and rushed
barking by Stoke-under-Trent, the capital
of the Potteries and also&mdash;though we had
not breath to mention it&mdash;the birthplace of
Dinah Mulock Craik. In the last town of
the line, Longtown, our machine fairly balked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
and the chauffeur with dignity retired under
it. A crowd of keen-faced men and children
gathered about us, while we ungoggled to
observe the endless ranks of house-doors
opening into baby-peopled passages,&mdash;and,
looming through the murky air, the bulging
ovens of the china factories. At last our
monster snorted on again, wiggling up the
hill sideways with a grace peculiar to itself
and exciting vain hopes of a wreck in the
hearts of our attendant urchins. It must
have been the Potteries that disagreed with
it, for no sooner were their files of chimneys
left behind than it set off at a mad pace for
Uttoxeter, on whose outskirts we "alighted,"
like Royalty, for a wayside luncheon of sandwiches,
ale, and dust.</p>

<a name="POTT" id="POTT"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_150.jpg" width="600" height="442" alt="IN THE POTTERIES&mdash;A CHILD-MOTHER" title="" />
<span class="caption">IN THE POTTERIES&mdash;A CHILD-MOTHER</span>
</div>

<p>Uttoxeter is no longer the idle little town
that Hawthorne found it, when he made pilgrimage
thither in honour of Dr. Johnson's
penance, for the good Doctor, heart-troubled
for fifty years because in boyhood he once
refused to serve in his father's stead at the
market bookstall, had doomed himself to
stand, the whole day long, in the staring
market-place, wind and rain beating against
his bared grey head, "a central image<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
of Memory and Remorse." Lichfield, Dr.
Johnson's native city, commemorates this
characteristic act by a bas-relief on the pedestal
of the statue standing opposite the three-pillared
house where the greatest of her sons
was born.</p>

<p>While our chauffeur, resting from his labours
under the hedge, genially entertained the
abuse of a drunken tramp who was accusing
us all of luxury, laziness, and a longing to
run down our fellowmen, my thoughts turned
wistfully to Lichfield, lying due south, to
whose "Queen of English Minsters" we were
ashamed to present our modern hippogriff.
I remembered waking there one autumnal
morning, years ago, at the famous old inn of
the Swan, and peering from my window to
see that wooden bird, directly beneath it,
flapping in a rainy gale. The cathedral rose
before the mental vision,&mdash;the grace of its
three spires; its wonderful west front with
tiers of saints and prophets and archangels,
"a very Te Deum in stone"; the delicate
harmonies of colour and line within; the
glowing windows of the Lady Chapel; the
"heaven-loved innocence" of the two little
sisters sculptured by Chantrey, and his kneeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
effigy of a bishop so benignant even in
marble that a passing child slipped from her
mother's hand and knelt beside him to say
her baby prayers. What books had been
shown me there in that quiet library above
the chapter-house! I could still recall the
richly illuminated manuscript of the "Canterbury
Tales," a volume of Dr. South's sermons
with Dr. Johnson's rough, vigorous
pencil-marks all up and down the margins,
and, treasure of treasures, an eighth-century
manuscript of St. Chad's Gospels. For this
is St. Chad's cathedral, still his, though the
successive churches erected on this site have
passed like human generations, each building
itself into the next.</p>

<p>St. Chad, hermit and bishop, came from
Ireland as an apostle to Mercia in the seventh
century. Among his first converts were the
king's two sons, martyred for their faith.
Even in these far distant days his tradition
is revered, and on Holy Thursday the choristers
of the cathedral yet go in procession to
St. Chad's Well, bearing green boughs and
chanting. A century or so ago, the well was
adorned with bright garlands for this festival.
The boy Addison, whose father was Dean of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Lichfield, may have gathered daffodils and
primroses to give to good St. Chad.</p>

<p>The ancient city has other memories. Farquhar
set the scene of his "Beaux' Stratagem"
there. Major André knew those shaded
walks. In the south transept of the cathedral
is the sepulchre of Garrick, whose death,
the inscription tells us, "eclipsed the gaiety
of nations and impoverished the public stock
of harmless pleasure." It may be recalled
that Hawthorne found it "really pleasant" to
meet Lady Mary Wortley Montagu's tomb in
the minster, and that Scott asserts there used
to be, in "moated Lichfield's lofty pile," a
monument to Marmion, whose castle stood a
few miles to the southeast, at Tamworth.</p>

<p>But the motor-car, full-fed with gasoline,
would brook no further pause. As self-important
as John Hobs, the famous Tanner
of Tamworth whom "not to know was to
know nobody," it stormed through Uttoxeter
and on, outsmelling the breweries of Burton-on-Trent.
Ducks, hens, cats, dogs, babies,
the aged and infirm, the halt and the blind,
scuttled to left and right. Policemen glared
out at it from their "motor-traps" in the
hedges. A group of small boys sent a rattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
of stones against it. Rocester! Only three
miles away were the ruins of the Cistercian
Abbey of Croxden. We would have liked
to see them, if only to investigate the story
that the heart of King John is buried there,
for we had never before heard that he had
a heart; but while we were voicing our desire
we had already crossed the Dove and whizzed
into Derbyshire.</p>

<p>Dovedale was our goal. This beautiful
border district of Derby and Staffordshire
abounds in literary associations. Near Ilam
Hall, whose grounds are said to have suggested
to Dr. Johnson the "happy valley"
in "Rasselas," and in whose grotto Congreve
wrote his "Old Bachelor," stands the famous
Isaak Walton Inn. The patron saint of the
region is the Gentle Angler, who in these
"flowery meads" and by these "crystal
streams" loved to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"see a black-bird feed her young,<br /></span>

again on the Fishing-House which has stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
since 1674 "Piscatoribus sacrum," his initials
are interlaced with those of his friend and
fellow-fisherman Charles Cotton, the patron
sinner of the locality. In Beresford Dale
may be found the little cave where this gay
and thriftless gentleman, author of the second
part of "The Complete Angler," used to hide
from his creditors. At Wootton Hall Jean
Jacques Rousseau once resided for over a
year, writing on his "Confessions" and amusing
himself scattering through Dovedale the
seeds of many of the mountain plants of
France. In a cottage at Church Mayfield,
Moore wrote his "Lalla Rookh," and near
Colwich Abbey once stood the house in which
Handel composed much of the "Messiah."</p>

<p>We did not see any of these spots. The
automobile would none of them. It whisked
about giddily half an hour, ramping into
the wrong shrines and out again, disconcerting
a herd of deer and a pack of young
fox-hounds, and then impetuously bolted
back to Uttoxeter. There were antiquities
all along the way,&mdash;British barrows, Roman
camps, mediæval churches, Elizabethan mansions,&mdash;but
the dusty and odoriferous trail of
our car was flung impartially over them all.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span></p>

<p>We shot through Uttoxeter and went whirring
on. A glimpse of the hillside ruins of
Chartley Castle brought a fleeting sorrow for
Mary Queen of Scots. It was one of those
many prisons that she knew in the bitter years
between Cockermouth and Fotheringay,&mdash;the
years that whitened her bright hair and
twisted her with cruel rheumatism. She was
harried from Carlisle in Cumberland to
Bolton Castle in Yorkshire, and thence sent
to Tutbury, on the Derby side of the Dove,
in custody of the unlucky Earl of Shrewsbury
and his keen-eyed, shrewish-tongued dame,
Bess of Hardwick. But still the poor queen
was shifted from one stronghold to another.
Yorkshire meted out to her Elizabeth's harsh
hospitality at Sheffield, Warwickshire at
Coventry, Leicestershire at Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
Derbyshire at Wingfield Manor and
Chatsworth and Hardwick Hall, even at
Buxton, where she was occasionally allowed
to go for the baths, and Staffordshire at Tixall
and here at Chartley. It was while she was
at Chartley, with Sir Amyas Paulet for her
jailer, that the famous Babington conspiracy
was hatched, and anything but an automobile
would have stopped and searched for that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
stone wall in which a brewer's boy deposited
the incriminating letters, read and copied
every one by Walsingham before they reached
the captive.</p>

<p>At Weston we jumped the Trent again
and pounded on to Stafford, the shoemakers'
town, where we came near knocking two
bicyclists into a ditch. They were plain-spoken
young men, and, addressing themselves
to the chauffeur, they expressed an
unfavourable opinion of his character. Stafford
lies half-way between the two coal-fields
of the county. Directly south some fifteen
miles is Wolverhampton, the capital of the
iron-manufacturing district. We remembered
that Stafford was the birthplace of
Isaak Walton, but it was too late to gain
access to the old Church of St. Mary's,
which has his bust in marble and, to boot,
the strangest font in England. We climbed
the toilsome heights of Stafford Castle for the
view it was too dark to see, and then once
more delivered ourselves over to the champing
monster, which spun us back to Shrewsbury
through a weird, infernal world flaring
with tongues of fire.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_HEART_OF_ENGLAND_WARWICKSHIRE" id="THE_HEART_OF_ENGLAND_WARWICKSHIRE"></a>THE HEART OF ENGLAND&mdash;WARWICKSHIRE</h2>


<p>A few miles to the northwest of Coventry
lies the village of Meriden, which is
called the centre of England. There
on a tableland is a little pool from which the
water flows both west and east, on the one
side reaching the Severn and the British Channel,
on the other the Trent and the North Sea.
"Leafy Warwickshire" is watered, as all the
world knows, by the Avon. The county,
though its borders show here and there a hilly
fringe, and though the spurs of the Cotswolds
invade it on the south, is in the main a fertile
river-basin, given over to agriculture and to
pasturage. The forest of Arden, that once
covered the Midlands, is still suggested by
rich-timbered parks and giant trees of ancient
memory. On the north, Warwickshire
tapers up into the Staffordshire coal-fields
and puts on a manufacturing character. The
great town of this district is Birmingham,
capital of the hardware industries.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span></p>

<p>It was from Birmingham that we started
out on our Warwickshire trip. We had but
a hasty impression of a well-built, prosperous,
purposeful town, but if we had known at the
time what masterpieces of the Pre-Raphaelite
Brotherhood were to be seen in the Art Gallery
we would have taken a later train than
we did for Nuneaton. Here we bade farewell
to railways, having decided to "post" through
the county. Our automobile scamper across
Staffordshire had left us with a conviction that
this mode of travel was neither democratic
nor becoming,&mdash;least of all adapted to a
literary pilgrimage. We preferred to drive
ourselves, but the English hostlers, shaking
their stolid heads, preferred that we should
be driven. It was only by a lucky chance
that we had found, in the Lake Country, a
broad-minded butcher who would trust us on
short expeditions with "Toby" and a pony-cart.
After all, it is easier to adapt yourself
to foreign ways than to adapt them to you,
and the old, traditional, respectable method
of travel in England is by post. The regular
rate for a victoria&mdash;which carries light luggage&mdash;and
a single horse is a shilling a mile,
with no charge for return, but with a considerable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
tip to the driver. In out-of-the-way
places the rate was sometimes only ninepence
a mile, but in the regions most affected by
tourists it might run up to eighteenpence. So
at Nuneaton we took a carriage for Coventry,
a distance, with the digressions we proposed,
of about twelve miles, and set out, on a fair
August afternoon, to explore the George
Eliot country.</p>

<p>Our driver looked blank at the mention of
George Eliot, but brightened at the name of
Mary Anne Evans. He could not locate for
us, however, the school which she had attended
in Nuneaton, but assured us that "Mr.
Jones 'ud know." To consult this oracle we
drove through a prosaic little town, dodging
the flocks of sheep that were coming in
for the fair, to a stationer's shop. Mr.
Jones, the photographer of the neighbourhood,
proved to be as well versed in George
Eliot literature and George Eliot localities
as he was generous in imparting his knowledge.
He mapped out our course with all
the concern and kindliness of a host, and
practically conferred upon us the freedom of
the city.</p>

<p>Nuneaton was as placidly engaged in making<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
hats and ribbons as if the foot of genius
had never hallowed its soil, and went its ways,
regardless while we peered out at inns and
residences mirrored in George Eliot's writings.
The school to which Robert Evans'
"little lass" used to ride in on donkeyback
every morning, as the farmers' daughters ride
still, is The Elms on Vicarage Street,&mdash;a
plain bit of a place, with its bare walls and
hard forms, to have been the scene of the
awakening of that keen intelligence. We
were duly shown the cloak-closet, to reach
whose hooks a girl of eight or nine must have
had to stand on tiptoe, the small classrooms,
and the backyard that served as a playground.
The educational equipment was of the simplest,&mdash;but
what of that? Hamlet could
have been "bounded in a nutshell," and here
there was space enough for thought. A Nuneaton
lady, lodging with the caretaker during
the vacation, told us with a touch of quiet
pride that her husband had known "Marian
Evans" well in their young days, and had
often walked home with her of an evening
from the rectory.</p>

<p>As we drove away toward that rectory in
Chilvers Coton, the parish adjoining Nuneaton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
on the south, we could almost see the
little schoolgirl riding homeward on her
donkey. It is Maggie Tulliver, of "The Mill
on the Floss," who reveals the nature of that
tragic child, "a creature full of eager and
passionate longing for all that was beautiful
and glad; thirsty for all knowledge;
with an ear straining after dreamy music that
died away, and would not come near to her;
with a blind, unconscious yearning for something
that would link together the wonderful
impressions of this mysterious life, and give
her soul a sense of home in it."</p>

<p>Chilvers Coton, like Nuneaton, has no
memories of its famous woman of letters.
The only time we saw her name that afternoon
was as we drove, two hours later, through
a grimy colliery town where a row of posters
flaunted the legend:</p>

<p class="center">
ASK FOR GEORGE ELIOT SAUCE.</p>

<p>But in the Chilvers Coton church, familiar
to readers of "Scenes from Clerical Life," is
a window given by Mr. Isaac Evans in
memory of his wife, not of his sister, with an
inscription so like Tom Tulliver's way of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
admonishing Maggie over the shoulder that
we came near resenting it:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"She layeth her hands to the spindle."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But we would not flout the domestic virtues,
and still less would we begrudge Tom's wife&mdash;not
without her share of shadow, for no
people are so hard to live with as those who
are always right&mdash;her tribute of love and
honour. So with closed lips we followed the
sexton out into the churchyard, past the much
visited grave of "Milly Barton," past the
large recumbent monument that covers the
honest ashes of Robert Evans of Griff, and
past so many fresh mounds that we exclaimed
in dismay. Our guide, however, viewed them
with a certain decorous satisfaction, and intimated
that for this branch of his craft times
were good in Chilvers Coton, for an epidemic
was rioting among the children. "I've had
twelve graves this month already," he said,
"and there"&mdash;pointing to where a spade
stood upright in a heap of earth&mdash;"I've got
another to-day." We demurred about detaining
him, with such pressure of business
on his hands, but he had already led us, over
briars and sunken slabs, to a stone inscribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
with the name of Isaac Pearson Evans of
Griff and with the text:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The memory of the just is blessed."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As we stood there, with our attendant ghoul
telling us, in rambling, gossipy fashion, what
a respectable man Mr. Isaac Evans was, and
how he never would have anything to do with
"his sister for years, but after she married
Mr. Cross he took her up again and went to
her funeral,"&mdash;how could we force out of
mind a passage that furnishes such strange
commentary on that graven line?</p>

<blockquote><p>"Tom, indeed, was of opinion that Maggie was a
silly little thing. All girls were silly.... Still he was
very fond of his sister, and meant always to take care
of her, make her his housekeeper, and punish her when
she did wrong.... Tom, you perceive, was rather a
Rhadamanthine personage, having more than the usual
share of boy's justice in him&mdash;the justice that desires
to hurt culprits as much as they deserve to be hurt, and
is troubled with no doubts concerning the exact amount
of their deserts."</p></blockquote>

<p>It is in this parish of Chilvers Coton that
George Eliot was born, in a quiet brown
house set among laden apple-trees, as we saw
it, with a bright, old-fashioned garden of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
dahlias, sweet peas, and hollyhocks. The
place is known as South Farm or Arbury
Farm, for it is on the grounds of Arbury
Priory, one of the smaller monasteries that
fell prey to Henry VIII, now held by the Newdigate
family. We drove to it through a
park of noble timber, where graceful deer
were nibbling the aristocratic turf or making
inquisitive researches among the rabbit warrens.
Robert Evans, of Welsh origin, was
a Staffordshire man. A house-builder's son,
he had himself begun life as a carpenter.
Adam Bede was made in his likeness. Rising
to the position of forester and then to that
of land agent, he was living, at the time of his
daughter's birth, at Arbury Farm, in charge
of the Newdigate estate. Three or four
months later he removed to Griff, an old
brick farmhouse standing at a little distance
from the park, on the highroad. Griff House
passed, in due course of time, from the occupancy
of Robert Evans to that of his son, and
on the latter's death, a few years ago, was
converted into a Dairy School "for gentleman-farmers'
daughters." Pleasant and benignant
was its look that August afternoon,
as it stood well back among its beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
growth of trees,&mdash;cut-leaf birch and yellowing
chestnut, Cedar of Lebanon, pine, locust,
holly, oak, and yew, with a pear-tree pleached
against the front wall on one side, while the
other was thickly overgrown with ivy. Geraniums
glowed about the door, and the mellow
English sunshine lay softly over all. This
was a sweet and tender setting for the figure
of that ardent wonder-child,&mdash;a figure imagination
could not disassociate from that of
the sturdy elder brother, whose presence&mdash;if
he were in affable and condescending mood&mdash;made
her paradise.</p>

<blockquote><p>"They trotted along and sat down together, with no
thought that life would ever change much for them.
They would only get bigger and not go to school, and
it would always be like the holidays; they would always
live together and be fond of each other.... Life did
change for Tom and Maggie; and yet they were not
wrong in believing that the thoughts and loves of those
first years would always make part of their lives. We
could never have loved this earth so well if we had had
no childhood in it."</p></blockquote>

<p>We forgave, as we lingered in that gracious
scene, "the memory of the just." For all
Tom's virtues, he had given Maggie, though
she was her father's darling and had no lack<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
of indulgent love about her, the best happiness
of her childhood. Across the years of
misunderstanding and separation she could
write:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But were another childhood's world my share,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I would be born a little sister there."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>We had even a disloyal impulse of sympathy
for these kinsfolk of genius, who must
needs pay the price by having their inner
natures laid bare before the world, but we
checked it. Our worlds, little or large, are
bound to say and believe something concerning
us: let us be content in proportion as it
approximates the truth.</p>

<p>Our road to Coventry ran through a mining
district. Every now and then we met
groups of black-faced colliers. Robert Evans
must often have driven his daughter along
this way, for in her early teens she was at
school in the City of the Three Spires, and
later on, when her widowed father resigned
to his son his duties as land agent, and Griff
House with them, she removed there with him
to make him a new home. The house is still
to be seen in Foleshill road, on the approach
from the north; but here the star of George<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
Eliot pales before a greater glory, the all-eclipsing
splendour, for at Coventry we are
on the borders of the Shakespeare country.</p>

<p>Stratford-on-Avon lies only twenty miles
to the south, and what were twenty miles to
the creator of Ariel and Puck? Surely his
young curiosity must have brought him early
to this</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Quaint old town of toil and trouble,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Quaint old town of art and song."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The noble symmetries of St. Michael's, its
companion spires of Holy Trinity and Grey
Friars, the narrow streets and over-jutting
housetops, the timber-framed buildings, the
frescoed walls and carven window-heads, all
that we see to-day of the mediæval fashion he
must have seen in fresher beauty, and far
more; yet even then the glory of Coventry
had departed. From the eleventh century,
when Leofric, Earl of Mercia, and his Countess
of beloved memory, the Lady Godiva,
built their magnificent abbey, of which hardly
a trace remains, the city had been noted for its
religious edifices. Its triple-spired cathedral
of St. Mary,&mdash;existing to-day in but a few
foundation fragments,&mdash;its monasteries and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
nunneries and churches of the various orders
formed an architectural group unmatched
in England. Coventry was conspicuous, too,
for civic virtues. As its merchants increased
in riches, they lavished them freely on their
queenly town. The Earl in his now crumbled
castle and the Lord Abbot had hitherto divided
the rule, but in 1345 came the first
Mayor. It was while the Rose-red Richard
sat so gaily on his rocking throne that Coventry
celebrated the completion of its massive
walls, three miles in circuit, with twelve gates
and thirty-two towers. In the middle of the
fifteenth century it received a special charter,
and Henry VI declared it "the best governed
city in all his realm." It was then that the
famous guilds of Coventry were at their
height, for its merchants had waxed wealthy
in the wool trade, and its artisans were cunning
at cloth-making.</p>

<p>As we stood in St. Mary's Hall, erected
toward the end of the fourteenth century by
the united fraternities known as the Holy
Trinity Guild, we realised something of the
devotional spirit and artistic joy of those old
craftsmen. The oak roof of the Great Hall
is exquisitely figured with a choir of angels<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
playing on their divers instruments. In the
kitchen&mdash;<i>such</i> a kitchen, with stone arches
and fine old timber-work!&mdash;another angel
peeps down to see that the service of spit and
gridiron is decorously done. The building
throughout abounds in carved panels, groined
roofs, state chairs of elaborate design, heraldic
insignia, portraits, grotesques, and displays
a marvellous tapestry, peopled with a softly
fading company of saints and bishops, kings
and queens.</p>

<p>Among the Coventry artists, that gladsome
throng of architects, painters, weavers,
goldsmiths, and silversmiths who wrought so
well for the adornment of their city, John
Thornton is best remembered. It was he
who made&mdash;so they say at Coventry&mdash;the
east window of York minster, and here in St.
Mary's Hall he placed superb stained glass
of harmoniously blended browns. We could
fancy a Stratford boy with hazel eyes intent
upon it, conning the faces of those English
kings to whom he was to give new life and
longer reigns. Henry VI holds the centre,
thus revealing the date of the window, and
near him are Henry IV and Henry V, Lancastrian
usurpers to whose side the partial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
dramatist has lured us all. It was to join
their forces at Shrewsbury that he sent Falstaff
marching through Coventry with his
ragged regiment, whose every soldier looked
like "Lazarus in the painted cloth." Richard
II is conspicuous by his absence, but in writing
his tragedy the young Shakespeare remembered
that Coventry was the scene of
the attempted trial at arms between Bolingbroke
and the Duke of Norfolk. The secret
cause of the combat involved the honour of
Richard, and he, not daring to trust the issue,
threw "his warder down," forbade the duel,
and sentenced both champions to</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"tread the stranger paths of banishment."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But Shakespeare's Coventry, like Shakespeare's
London, was largely a city of ruins.
Broken towers and desolate courts told of
the ruthless sweep of the Reformation. The
cloth trade, too, was falling off, and even that
blue thread whose steadfast dye gave rise to
the proverb "True as Coventry blue" was
less in demand under Elizabeth than under
Henry VIII. Yet though so much of its
noble ecclesiastical architecture was defaced
or overthrown, though its tide of fortune had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
turned, the city was lovely still, among its
most charming buildings being various charitable
institutions founded and endowed by
wealthy citizens. That exquisite timber-and-plaster
almshouse for aged women, Ford's
Hospital, then almost new, may have gained
in mellow tints with time, but its rich wood-work,
one fretted story projecting over another
like the frilled heads of antiquated
dames, row above row, peering out to see
what might be passing in the street beneath,
must have delighted the vision then as it delights
it still. I dare say Will Shakespeare,
saucy lad that he was, doffed his cap and
flashed a smile as reviving as a beam of sunshine
at some wistful old body behind the
diamond panes of her long and narrow window.
For there she would have been sitting,
as her successor is sitting yet, trying to be
thankful for her four shillings a week, her fuel,
her washing, and her doctoring, but ever, in
her snug corner, dusting and rearranging the
bits of things,&mdash;cups and spoons, a cushion
or two, Scripture texts,&mdash;her scanty salvage
from the wreck of home. That the pathos
of the old faces enhances the picturesqueness
of it all, those eyes so keen to read the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
book of human life would not have failed to
note.</p>

<p>Coventry would have had for the seeking
heart of a poet other attractions than those of
architectural beauty. It was a storied city,
with its treasured legend of Lady Godiva's
ride&mdash;a legend not then vulgarised by
the Restoration addition of Peeping Tom&mdash;and
with its claim to be the birthplace of
England's patron saint, the redoubtable
dragon slayer. A fourteenth-century poet
even asserts of St. George and his bride
that they</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"many years of joy did see;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They lived and died in Coventree."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It had a dim memory of some old-time
slaughter&mdash;perhaps of Danes&mdash;commemorated
in its play of Hock Tuesday. Coventry
was, indeed, a "veray revelour" in plays and
pageants, and if nothing else could have
brought a long-limbed, wide-awake youth to
try what his Rosalind and Celia and Orlando
found so easy, a holiday escapade in the
Forest of Arden, we may be all but sure the
Corpus Christi Mysteries would have given
the fiend the best of the argument with conscience.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
It is not likely, however, that it had
to be a runaway adventure. That worshipful
alderman, John Shakespeare, was himself
of a restless disposition and passing fond of
plays. He would have made little, in the
years of his prosperity, of a summer-day
canter to Coventry, with his small son of
glowing countenance mounted on the same
stout nag. Later on, when debts and lawsuits
were weighing down his spirits, the
father may have turned peevish and withheld
both his company and his horse, but by that
time young Will, grown tall and sturdy, could
have trudged it, putting his enchanting tongue
to use, when his legs, like Touchstone's, were
weary, in winning a lift from some farmer's
wain for a mile or so along the road. But by
hook or by crook he would be there, laughing
in his doublet-sleeve at the blunders of the
"rude mechanicals"&mdash;of the tailors who
were playing the Nativity and of the weavers
on whose pageant platform was set forth
the Presentation in the Temple. Robin
Starveling the Tailor, and his donkeyship
Nick Bottom the Weaver, were they not
natives of Coventry? And when the truant&mdash;if
truant he was&mdash;came footsore back to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
Stratford and acted over again in the Henley
Street garden, sweet with June, the "swaggering"
of the "hempen home-spuns," did
not his gentle mother hide her smiles by
stooping to tend her roses, while the father's
lungs, despite himself, began to "crow like
Chanticleer"?</p>

<p>Foolish city, to have kept no record of those
visits of the yeoman's son, that dusty youngster
with the dancing eyes! When royal personages
came riding through your gates, you
welcomed them with stately ceremonies and
splendid gifts, with gay street pageants and
gold cups full of coin. Your quills ran verse
as lavishly as your pipes ran wine. You had
ever a loyal welcome for poor Henry VI; and
for his fiery queen, Margaret of Anjou, you
must needs present, in 1456, St. Margaret
slaying the dragon. Four years later, though
with secret rage, you were tendering an ovation
to her arch enemy and conqueror, Edward
IV. Here this merry monarch kept his
Christmas in 1465, and nine years later came
again to help you celebrate the feast of St.
George. For Prince Edward, three years
old, your Mayor and Council, all robed in
blue and green, turned out in 1474, while<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
players strutted before the child's wondering
eyes, while the music of harp and viol filled
his ears, and the "Children of Issarell" flung
flowers before his little feet. His murderer,
Richard III, you received with no less elaborate
festivities nine years later, when he came
to see your Corpus Christi plays. But it was
to you that his supplanter, Henry VII, repaired
straight from the victory of Bosworth
Field, and you, never Yorkist at heart, flew
your banners with enthusiastic joy. His
heir, Arthur, a winsome and delicate prince,
you greeted with unconscious irony, four
years before his death, by the blessings of the
Queen of Fortune. You summoned the
"Nine Orders of Angels," with a throng of
"divers beautiful damsels," to welcome Henry
VIII and the ill-omened Catherine of Aragon
in 1510. They were sumptuously entertained
at your glorious Priory, for whose destruction
that graceless guest, the King, was presently
to seal command. But before its day of
doom it sheltered one more royal visitor of
yours, the Princess Mary, who came in 1525
to see the Mercers' Pageant. In 1565, the
year after Shakespeare's birth, you fêted with
all splendour Queen Elizabeth, the last of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
Tudors, and in 1616, the year of Shakespeare's
death, you spread the feast for King James,
the first of the Stuarts. But you have forgotten
your chief guest of all, the roguish
youngster munching his bread and cheese in
the front rank of the rabble, the heaven-crowned
poet who was to be more truly king-maker
than the great Warwick himself.</p>

<p>Our first seeing of the name of Warwick in
Warwickshire was over a green-grocer's shop
in Coventry. The green-grocer was all very
well, but the sewing-machine factories and,
worse yet, the flourishing business in bicycles
and motor-cars jarred on our sixteenth-century
dream. I am ashamed to confess how
speedily we accomplished our Coventry sightseeing,
and how early, on the day following our
arrival, we took the road again. We set out
in our sedate victoria with high expectations,
for we had been told over and over that the
route from Coventry to Warwick was "the
most beautiful drive in England." For most
of the distance we found it a long, straight,
level avenue, bordered by large trees. There
were few outlooks; clouds of dust hung in
the air, and gasoline odours trailed along the
way. We counted it, as a drive, almost the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
dullest of our forty odd, but it was good roading,
and the opinion of the horse may have
been more favourable.</p>

<p>Five miles brought us to Kenilworth, about
whose stately ruins were wandering the usual
summer groups of trippers and tourists. Its
ivies were at their greenest and its hollies
glistened with an emerald sheen, but when I
had last seen the castle, in a far-away October,
those hollies were yet more beautiful with gold-edged
leaves and with ruby berries. Then,
as now, the lofty red walls seemed to me to
wear an aspect, if not of austerity, at least of
courtly reserve, as if, whoever might pry and
gossip, their secrets were still their own. In
point of fact, the bewitchments of Sir Walter
Scott have made it well-nigh impossible for
any of us to bear in mind that in the ancient
fortress of Kenilworth King John was wont
to lurk, spinning out his spider-webs, that
Simon de Montfort once exercised gay lordship
here, and here, in sterner times, held
Henry III and Prince Edward prisoners;
that these towers witnessed the humiliation
of the woful Edward II, and that in these
proud halls the mirth-loving Queen Bess had
been entertained by the Earl of Leicester on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
three several occasions prior to the famous
visit of 1575. On her first coming our poet
was a prattler of two&mdash;if only Mistress
Shakespeare had kept a "Baby Record"!&mdash;and
I am willing to admit that the event may
not have interested him. When her second
royal progress excited Warwickshire, he was
a four-year-old, teasing his mother for fairy
stories, and peeping into the acorn-cups for
hidden elves, but hardly likely to have been
chosen to play the part of Cupid while</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"the imperial votaress passèd on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In maiden meditation, fancy-free."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>As a boy of eight, however, a "gallant child,
one that makes old hearts fresh," he may have
stood by the roadside, or been perched on
some friendly shoulder to add his shrill note
to the loyal shout when the Queen rode by
amid her retinue; and three years later, I
warrant his quick wits found a way to see
something of those glittering shows, those
"princely pleasures of Kenilworth Castle,"
which lasted nineteen days and were the talk
of the county. How eagerly his winged imagination
would have responded to the Lady
of the Lake, to Silvanus, Pomona and Ceres,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
to the "savage man" and the satyrs, to the
"triton riding on a mermaid 18 foot long;
as also Arion on a dolphin, with rare music"!<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>
If we did not think so much about Amy Robsart
at Kenilworth as, according to Scott, we
should have done, it is because we were unfortunate
enough to know that she perished
fifteen years before these high festivities,&mdash;three
years, indeed, before the Castle was
granted to Robert Dudley.</p>

<p>Stoneleigh Abbey, with its tempting portraits,
lay three miles to the left, and we would
not swerve from our straight road, which,
however, grew more exciting as we neared
Warwick, for it took us past Blacklow Hill,
to whose summit, six hundred years ago, the
fierce barons of Edward II dragged his French
favourite, Piers Gaveston, and struck off that
jaunty head, which went bounding down the
hill to be picked up at the bottom by a friar,
who piously bore it in his hood to Oxford.</p>

<p>We halted again at Guy's Cliff, constrained
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>by its ancient tradition of Guy, Earl of Warwick,
he who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"did quell that wondrous cow"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>of Dunsmore Heath. My own private respect
for horned beasts kept me from flippantly
undervaluing this exploit. After other
doughty deeds, giants, monsters, and Saracens
falling like ninepins before him, Guy returned
in the odour of sanctity from the Holy Land,
but instead of going home to Warwick, where
his fair countess was pining, he sought out
this cliff rising from the Avon and, in a convenient
cavity, established himself as a hermit.
Every day he begged bread at the gate of his
own castle, and his wife, not recognising her
dread lord in this meek anchorite, supplied
his needs. Just before his end he sent her a
ring, and she, thus discovering the identity of
the beggar, sped to the cave, arriving just in
time to see him die. Other hermits succeeded
to his den, and in the reign of Henry VI,
Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick,
founded a chantry there. Henry VIII made
short work of that, and the romantic rocks
passed from one owner to another, the present
mansion having been built above them in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
eighteenth century. Guy's Cliff was termed
by Leland "a place delightful to the muses,"
and we were pleased to find it still enjoyed
their favour. One of those supernaturally
dignified old servitors who hang about to
catch the pennies struck an attitude on the
bridge and, informing us that he was a poet
and had had verses in print, recited with
touching earnestness the following effusion:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"'Ere yer can sit and rest a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i6">And watch the wild ducks dive in play,<br /></span>

<span class="caption">FEEDING THE PEACOCKS AT WARWICK CASTLE</span>
</div>

<p>Warwick, a wide-streeted, stately old town,
with two of its mediæval gates still standing,
was familiar to us both. I had spent a week
here, some years ago, and taken occasion,
after inspecting the lions, to view the horses,
for the autumn races chanced to be on. I
remember sitting, surprised at myself, on the
grand stand, in an atmosphere of tobacco
smoke and betting. The bookmakers stood
below, conspicuous in green velveteen coats;
some had their names on the open money-bags
hanging from their necks; all were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
shouting themselves hoarse. A red-nosed
lady in dashing apparel sat on my right, enlightening
my ignorance with a flood of jockey
English, while on my left a plain-faced, anxious
little body would turn from helping her
husband decide his bets to urge upon me the
superior morality of this to all other forms of
English sport. The green below was filled
with a bustling crowd of men, women, and
children, pressing about the booths, the
Punch-and-Judys and the show-carts, adventuring
upon the swings and merry-go-rounds,
tossing balls at gay whirligigs and
winning cocoanuts in the fascinating game
of "Aunt Sally," or ransacking the "silken
treasury,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Lawns as white as driven snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Cyprus black as e'er was crow,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>of many a modern Autolycus. The throng
was bright with fluttering pennons, red soldier
coats, and the vivid finery of housemaids on
a holiday. I saw five out of the seven races
sweep by and waxed enthusiastic over "Porridge"
and "Odd Mixture," but "good old
Maggie Cooper," on which my red-nosed
neighbour lost heavily, while the husband of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
my moral little friend won, put me to such
embarrassment between them that I bethought
myself of my principles and slipped
away.</p>

<p>Eschewing such profane reminiscences, I
recalled the Church of St. Mary, with its
haughty Beauchamp Chapel where ancient
Earls of Warwick keep their marble state, together
with the Earl of Leicester and his
"noble impe." I recalled the delectable home
for old soldiers, Leycester's Hospital, so inimitably
described by Hawthorne. Across
the years I still could see the antique quadrangle
with its emblazoned scutcheons and
ornately lettered texts; the vaulted hall with
its great carven beams; the delightful kitchen
with its crested fireplace of huge dimensions,
its oaken settles and copper flagons, its Saxon
chair that has rested weary mortality for a
thousand years, and its silken fragment of
Amy Robsart's needlework. Most clearly
of all rose from memory the figures of the old
pensioners, the "brethren" garbed in long
blue gowns with silver badge on shoulder,
stamped, as the whole building is stamped
over and over, with the cognisance of The
Bear and the Ragged Staff. I had done<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
homage at Warwick to the memory of Landor,
who was born there in a house dear to his
childhood for its mulberries and cedars, its
chestnut wood, and its fig tree at the window.
Partly for his sake I had visited Rugby, on
the eastern border of Warwickshire,&mdash;that
great public school which became, under Dr.
Arnold's mastership, such a power in English
life. Rugby disapproved of my special
interest, for it has had better boys than
Landor, so wild-tempered a lad that his
father was requested to remove him when,
only fifteen, he was within five of being head
of the school. But the neighbouring village
of Bilton entirely endorsed my motives when
I went the rounds of Bilton Hall as an act of
respectful sympathy for the eminent Mr.
Addison, who wedded the Dowager Countess
of Warwick and here resided with her for the
three years that his life endured under that
magnificent yoke.</p>

<p>With so much sightseeing to our credit, we
decided to limit our Warwick experiences on
this occasion to luncheon and the castle, for
although we both had "done" the splendid
home of the Earls of Warwick more than once,
even viewing it by moonlight and by dawnlight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
from the bridge across the Avon, it did
not seem decorous to pass by without leaving
cards&mdash;not our visiting cards, but those for
which one pays two shillings apiece in the
shop over against the gate.</p>

<p>Warwick Castle, built of the very centuries,
cannot be expected to alter with Time's
"brief hours and weeks"&mdash;at least, with so
few of them as fall to one poor mortal's lot.
From visit to visit I find it as unchanged as
the multiplication table. By that same chill
avenue, cut through the solid rock and densely
shaded, we passed into the same grassy court
lorded over by the same arrogant peacocks&mdash;who
have, however, developed an intemperate
appetite for sweet chocolate&mdash;and girt about
by the same proud walls and grey, embattled
towers. A princely seat of splendid memories,
one is half ashamed to join the inquisitive
procession that trails after a supercilious
guide through the series of state apartments&mdash;Great
Hall, Red Drawing Room, Cedar
Room, Gilt Drawing Room, Boudoir, Armory
Passage, and so on to the end. We looked at
the same relics,&mdash;old Guy's dubious porridge
pot, Marie Antoinette's mosaic table, Queen
Anne's red velvet bed, the mace of the King-maker,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
Cromwell's helmet; the same treasures
of rare workmanship and fabulous cost,&mdash;a
Venetian table inlaid with precious stones,
shimmering tapestries, enamelled cabinets and
clocks; the same notable succession of portraits
in which the varying art of Van Dyke,
Holbein, Rembrandt, Rubens, Lely, Kneller
has perpetuated some of the most significant
faces of history. How strangely they turn
their eyes on one another!&mdash;Anne Boleyn;
her Bluebeard, Henry VIII, pictured here not
only in his rank manhood, but as a sweet-lipped
child; Loyola in priestly vestments of
gold and crimson; the Earl of Strafford with
his doomful look; Charles I; Henrietta
Maria; Rupert of the Rhine; the heroic
Marquis of Montrose; the literary Duke of
Newcastle; the romantic Gondomar, Spanish
ambassador to Elizabeth; and with them&mdash;confuting
my rash statement that the castle
knows no change&mdash;Sargent's portrait of the
present Countess of Warwick, a democrat of
the democrats, enfolding her little son. There
remained the walk through the gardens to the
conservatory, whose Warwick Vase, said to
have been found in Hadrian's Villa, is, for all
its grandeur, less dear to memory than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
level green branches of the great cedars of
Lebanon. But when it came to peacocks
and pussycats cut in yew, we deemed it time
to resume our journey.</p>

</div>

<p>Leamington was close at hand, with its
Royal Pump Rooms, swimming-baths and
gardens, its villas and crescents and bath-chairs
and parades, its roll of illustrious invalids
who have drunk of its mineral waters;
but we would not turn aside for Leamington.
Dr. Parr's church at Hatton could not detain
us, nor other churches and mansions of renown,
nor the footsteps of the worthies of the
Gunpowder Plot, nor Edge Hill where Charles
I met the Parliamentarians in the first battle
of the Civil War, nor the park of Redway
Grange in which Fielding wrote&mdash;and
laughed as he wrote&mdash;a portion of "Tom
Jones," nor the Red Horse cut in turf, nor
any other of the many attractions of a
neighbourhood so crowded with memorials
of stirring life. Our thoughts were all of
Shakespeare now; our goal was Stratford-on-Avon.</p>

<p>Should we drive by the right bank of the
river, or the left? The choice lay between
Snitterfield and Charlecote Park. In Snitterfield,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
a village four miles to the north of Stratford,
the poet's paternal grandsire, Richard
Shakespeare, wore out a quiet yeoman life, tilling
the farm that he rented from Robert Arden
of Wilmcote, father of the poet's mother.
There must have been a strain of something
better than audacity in the tenant's son to win
him the hand of Mary Arden. Henry Shakespeare,
the poet's uncle, died at Snitterfield in
1596, when the quick scion of that slow blood
was in the first fever of his London successes.
But we chose the left-hand road and Charlecote
Park. For a while the sunny Avon,
silver-flecked with such swans as Shakespeare
and Ben Jonson may have smiled upon
together, bore us blithe company; then we
passed under the shadow of oaks with
"antique root" out-peeping, and of more</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"moss'd trees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That have outliv'd the eagle."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Before the Forest of Arden was cut away
for the use of the Droitwich salt-boilers and
other Vandals, the land was so thickly wooded
that tradition says a squirrel might have
skipped from bough to bough across the
county, without once touching the ground.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
Now it is rich glebe and tillage. We skirted
the broad acres of Charlecote Park and
viewed its "native burghers," the deer, but
were loth to believe that Shakespeare, even
in his heyday of youthful riot, would have
"let the law go whistle" for the sake of "a
hot venison-pasty to dinner." Yet it is like
enough that there was no love lost between
the Shakespeares and the Lucys, a family who
have held the manor since the twelfth century
and, in their Elizabethan representative, laid
themselves open to the suspicion of pompous
bearing and deficient sense of humour. The
<i>luces</i>, or pikes, in their coat of arms, the pun-loving
tongue of a "most acute juvenal"
could hardly have resisted. "The dozen
white louses do become an old coat well."
Sir Thomas Lucy entertained Queen Elizabeth
in 1572, and if the boys from Stratford
Grammar School were not in evidence at the
Park Gates on her arrival, it must have been
because Holofernes was drilling them for a
show of the Nine Worthies later on.</p>

<p>In the fields about the town the pea-pickers,
an autumn feature of this neighbourhood,
were already at work. They held our eyes
for a little and, when we looked forward again,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
there by the river rose the spire of Holy
Trinity, keeping its faithful watch and ward.
We clattered over the old stone bridge of fourteen
arches and there we were, between the
staring rows of tourist shops, all dealing in
Shakespeare commercialised. His likeness,
his name, his plays are pressed into every
huckster's service. The windows fairly
bristle with busts of Shakespeare of all sizes
and half a dozen colours; with models of the
Henley Street house, ranging in price, with
varying magnitude and material, from pennies
to pounds; with editions of his works,
from miniature copies to colossal; with photographs,
postal-cards, etchings, sketches; with
rubbings of his tombstone inscription; with
birthday books and wall texts, and with all
sorts of articles, paper-cutters, match-boxes,
pencil-trays, I dare say bootjacks, stamped
with verse or phrase of his. This poet-barter
is only a fraction of Shakespeare's endowment
of his native town. Innkeepers, porters,
drivers, guides, custodians are maintained
by him. Sir Thomas Lucy never dreamed
of such a retinue. Hardly did Warwick the
King-maker support so great a household.
He is not only Stratford's pride, but its prosperity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
and the welfare of the descendants of
Shakespeare's neighbours is not a matter for
the stranger to deplore. Nevertheless, we
hunted up lodgings, drank bad tea at one of
the Shakespeare Tea Rooms, and were out
of those greedy streets as quickly as possible
on a stroll across the old ridged fields to
Shottery.</p>

</div>

<p>On the way we met a sophisticated donkey,
who, waggling his ears, asked in Bottom's
name for a gratuity of "good sweet hay";
and a bevy of children scampered up, as we
neared Anne Hathaway's cottage, to thrust
upon us their wilted sprigs of lavender and
rosemary. They were merry little merchants,
however, and giggled understandingly when
we put them off with "No, thank you, William,"
"No, thank you, Anne." We arrived
a minute after six, and the cottage was closed
for the night, though a medley of indignant
pilgrims pounded at the garden gate and took
unavailing camera shots through the twilight.
But we were content with our dusky glimpse
of the timber-and-plaster, vinegrown walls
and low thatched roof. In former years we
had trodden that box-bordered path up to an
open door and had duly inspected fireplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
and settle, Bible and bacon-cupboard, and the
ancient bedstead. What we cared for most
this time was the walk thither, coming by that
worn footway toward the setting sun, as
Shakespeare would have come on his eager
lover's visits, and the return under a gossamer
crescent which yet served to suggest the
"blessed moon" that tipped</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"with silver all these fruit-tree tops"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>for a rash young Romeo who would better
have been minding his book at home.</p>

<p>The next morning we spent happily in revisiting
the Stratford shrines. Even the
catch-shilling shops bore witness, in their
garish way, to the supremacy of that genius
which brings the ends of the earth to this
Midland market-town.</p>

<p>The supposed birthplace is now converted,
after a chequered career, into a Shakespeare
Museum, where are treasured more or less
authentic relics and those first editions which
are worth their weight in radium. Built of
the tough Arden oak and of honest plaster,
it was a respectable residence for the times,
not unworthy of that versatile and vigorous
citizen who traded in corn and timber and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
wool and cattle, rose from the offices of ale-taster
and constable to be successively Chamberlain,
Alderman, and High Bailiff, and
loomed before the eyes of his little son as the
greatest man in the world. The house, whose
clay floors it may have been the children's
task to keep freshly strewn with rushes, would
have been furnished with oaken chests and
settles, stools, trestle-boards, truckle-beds,
and perhaps a great bedstead with carved
posts. Robert Arden, a man of property and
position, had left, among other domestic
luxuries, eleven "painted cloths"&mdash;naïve
representations of religious or classical subjects,
with explanatory texts beneath. His
daughter may have had some of these works
of art to adorn the walls of her Stratford home,
and, like enough, she brought her husband
a silver salt-cellar and a "fair garnish of
pewter." Her eldest son, whose plays "teach
courtesy to kings," was doubtless carefully
bred,&mdash;sent off early to school "with shining
morning face," and expected to wait on his
parents at their eleven o'clock breakfast before
taking his own, though we need feel no
concern about his going hungry. Trust him
for knowing, as he passed the trenchers and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
filled the flagons, how to get many a staying
nibble behind his father's back.</p>

<p>We wandered on to the Grammar School,
still located in the picturesque, half-timbered
building originally erected, toward the end
of the thirteenth century, by the Guild of the
Holy Cross. Here once was hospital as well
as school, and in the long hall on the ground
floor, even yet faintly frescoed with the Crucifixion,
the Guild held its meetings and kept
its feasts. Henry VIII made but half a bite
of all this, but the boy-king, Edward VI,
eleven years before Shakespeare's birth, gave
the ancient edifice back to Stratford. Then
the long hall was used for the deliberations
of the Town Council, and sometimes, especially
when John Shakespeare was in office,
for the performances of strolling players,&mdash;three
men and a boy, perhaps, travelling in
their costumes, which, by a little shifting and
furbishing, might serve for an old-fashioned
morality or a new-fangled chronicle, or,
should the schoolmaster's choice prevail, for
something newly Englished from the classics.
"Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor Plautus too
light." The school, thenceforth known as
Edward VI Grammar School, was permanently<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
established in the top story, where it
is still in active operation. Here we saw the
Latin room in which another William than
Mistress Page's hopeful was taught "to hick
and to hack," and the Mathematics room
where he learned enough arithmetic to "buy
spices for our sheep-shearing." He was only
fourteen or fifteen, it is believed, when his
father's business troubles broke off his schooling,
but not his education. Everywhere was
"matter for a hot brain." And he, who,
since the days when he "plucked geese,
played truant, and whipped top, ... knew
not what 'twas to be beaten," would have
borne up blithely against this seeming set-back.
Nature had given him "wit to flout
at Fortune," and these, too, were the red-blooded
years of youth, when he was ever
ready to "dance after a tabor and pipe"
and pay his laughing court to many a "queen
of curds and cream."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But, O, the thorns we stand upon!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The mature charms of Anne Hathaway
turned jest into earnest and sent prudence
down the wind. There was a hasty wedding,
nobody knows where, and John Shakespeare's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
burdens were presently increased by the advent
of three grandchildren. It was obviously
high time for this ne'er-do-well young
John-a-Dreams&mdash;"yet he's gentle; never
schooled, and yet learned; full of noble device;
of all sorts enchantingly beloved"&mdash;to
strike out into the world and seek his fortune.</p>

<p>Next to the Guild Hall stands the Guild
Chapel, whose former frescoes of the Day of
Judgment must have made deep impression
on the "eye of childhood that fears a painted
devil"; and over the way from the Guild
Chapel is New Place. On this site in the
time of Henry VII rose the Great House,
built by a Stratford magnate and benefactor,
Sir Hugh Clopton,&mdash;he who gave the town
that "fair Bridge of Stone over Avon." In
1597 Shakespeare, who could hardly have
been in London a dozen years, had prospered
so well, albeit in the disreputable crafts of
actor and playwright, that he bought the
estate, repaired the mansion then in "great
ruyne and decay," and renamed it New
Place. Yet although it was his hour of
triumph, his heart was sorrowful, for his only
son, his eleven-year-old Hamnet, "jewel of
children," had died the year before. At least<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
another decade passed before Shakespeare
finally withdrew from London and settled
down at New Place with the wife eight years
his senior, a plain country woman of Puritan
proclivities. In his twenty years of intense
creative life,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The inward service of the mind and soul"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>must have widened beyond any possible comprehension
of hers, nor can his two daughters,
unlettered and out of his world as they were,
have had much inkling of the career and
achievements of "so rare a wonder'd father."
His parents were dead. Their ashes may
now mingle with little Hamnet's in some forgotten
plot of the elm-shadowed churchyard.
Of his two daughters, Susanna, the elder, had
married a Stratford physician, and there was
a grandchild, little Elizabeth Hall, to brighten
the gardens of New Place. As I lingered
there,&mdash;for the gardens remain, though the
house is gone,&mdash;my eyes rested on a three-year-old
lass in a fluttering white frock,&mdash;no
wraith, though she might have been,&mdash;dancing
among the flowers with such uncertain
steps and tossing such tiny hands in air that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
the birds did not trouble themselves to take
to their wings, but hopped on before her like
playfellows.</p>

<p>The deepest of the Shakespeare mysteries
is, to my mind, the silence of those closing
years. Were nerves and brain temporarily
exhausted from the strain of that long period
of continuous production? Or had he come
home from London sore at heart, "toss'd
from wrong to injury," smarting from "the
whips and scorns of time" and abjuring the
"rough magic" of his art? Or was he, in
"the sessions of sweet silent thought," dreaming
on some high, consummate poem in comparison
with which the poor stage-smirched
plays seemed to him not worth the gathering
up? Or might he, taking a leaf out of Ben
Jonson's book, have been in fact arranging
and rewriting his works, purging his gold
from the dross of various collaborators? Or
was some new, inmost revelation of life dawning
upon him, holding him dumb with awe?
We can only ask, not answer; but certainly
they err who claim that the divinest genius of
English letters had wrought merely for house
and land, and found his chief reward in writing
"Gentleman" after his name.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>Shakespeare had been gentle before he was
a gentleman, and had held ever&mdash;let his
own words bear witness!&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Virtue and cunning were endowments greater<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>The gods had given him but fifty-two years
on earth&mdash;had they granted more, he might
have probed and uttered too many of their
secrets&mdash;when for the last time he was "with
holy bell ... knoll'd to church." It was
an April day when the neighbours bore a
hand-bier&mdash;as I saw a hand-bier borne a few
years since across the fields from Shottery&mdash;the
little way from New Place down Chapel
Lane and along the Waterside&mdash;or perhaps
by Church Street&mdash;and up the avenue, beneath
its blossoming limes, to Holy Trinity.</p>

<span class="i0">"Dear Son of Memory, great Heir of Fame,"<br /></span>

<p>I passed a peaceful hour, ruffled only&mdash;if
the truth must out&mdash;by the unjustifiable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
wrath which ever rises in me on reading Mrs.
Susanna Hall's epitaph. I can forgive the
"tombemaker" who wrought the bust, I can
endure the stained-glass windows, I can overlook
the alabaster effigy of John Combe in
Shakespeare's chancel, but I resent the Puritan
self-righteousness of the lines,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Witty above her sexe, but that's not all,<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Yes, I know that Shakespeare made her his
heiress, that she was clever and charitable,
that in July of 1643 she entertained Queen
Henrietta Maria at New Place, but I do not
care at all for the confusion of her bones when
"a person named Watts" intruded into her
grave fifty-eight years after she had taken
possession, and I believe she used her father's
manuscripts for wrapping up her saffron pies.</p>

<p>We spent the earlier half of the afternoon
in a drive among some of the outlying villages
of Stratford,&mdash;first to Wilmcote, the birthplace
of Shakespeare's mother. We dismissed
a fleeting thought of "Marian Hacket,
the fat ale-wife of Wincot," and sought only<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
for "Mary Arden's Cottage." Gabled and
dormer-windowed, of stout oak timbers and
a light brown plaster, it stands pleasantly
within its rustic greenery. Old stone barns
and leaning sheds help to give it an aspect
of homely kindliness. Robert Arden's will,
dated 1556, is the will of a good Catholic, bequeathing
his soul to God "and to our blessed
Lady, Saint Mary, and to all the holy company
of heaven." He directed that his body
should be buried in the churchyard of St.
John the Baptist in Aston-Cantlow. So we
drove on, a little further to the northwest,
and found an Early English church with a
pinnacled west tower. The air was sweet
with the roses and clematis that clambered
up the walls. It is here, in all likelihood,
that John Shakespeare and Mary Arden were
married.</p>

<p>We still pressed on, splashing through a
ford and traversing a surviving bit of the
Forest of Arden, to one village more, Wootton-Wawen,
with a wonderful old church whose
every stone could tell a story. Somervile the
poet, who loved Warwickshire so well, is
buried in the chantry chapel, and the white-haired
rector told us proudly that Shakespeare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
had often come to service there. Indeed,
Wootton-Wawen may have meant more to
the great dramatist and done more to shape
his destinies than we shall ever know, though
Shakespeare scholarship is beginning to turn
its searchlight on John Somervile of Edstone
Hall, whose wife was nearly related to Mary
Arden. Papist, as the whole Arden connection
seems to have been, John Somervile's
brain may have given way under the political
and religious troubles of those changeful
Tudor times. At all events, he suddenly set
out for London, declaring freely along the
road that he was going to kill the Queen. Arrest,
imprisonment, trial for high treason, conviction,
and a mysterious death in his Newgate
cell followed in terrible sequence. Nor did
the tragedy stop with him, but his wife, sister,
and priest were arrested on charge of complicity,
and not these only, but that quiet and
honourable gentleman, Edward Arden of
Park Hall in Wilmcote, with his wife and
brother. Francis Arden and the ladies were
in course of time released, but Edward Arden,
who had previously incurred the enmity of
Leicester by refusing to wear his livery,&mdash;a
flattery to which many of the Warwickshire<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
gentlemen eagerly stooped,&mdash;suffered, on December
20, 1583, the brutal penalty of the law,&mdash;hanged
and drawn and quartered, put to
death with torture, for no other crime than
that of having an excitable son-in-law and a
sturdy English sense of self-respect. A sad
and bitter Yule it must have been for his kinsfolk
in Wilmcote and in Stratford. There was
danger in the air, too; a hot word might give
Sir Thomas Lucy or some zealous Protestant
his chance; and there may well have been
graver reasons than a poaching frolic why
young Will Shakespeare should have disappeared
from the county.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_COTSWOLDS" id="THE_COTSWOLDS"></a>THE COTSWOLDS</h2>


<p>Late in the afternoon we started out from
Stratford for a peep at the Cotswolds,
swelling downs that belong in the main
to Oxfordshire, although, as our drive soon
revealed to us, Warwickshire, Gloucestershire,
Northamptonshire, and even Worcestershire
all come in for a share of these pastoral
uplands. It is in the Cotswolds, not far from
the estuary of the Severn, that the Thames
rises and flows modestly through Oxfordshire,
which lies wholly within its upper valley, to
become the commerce-laden river that takes
majestic course through the heart of London.</p>

<p>We were still in the Shakespeare country,
for his restless feet must often have roved
these breezy wilds, famous since ancient days
for hunts and races. "I am glad to see you,
good Master Slender," says genial Master
Page. And young Master Slender, with his
customary tact, replies: "How does your
fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
outrun on Cotsol." Whereupon Master Page
retorts a little stiffly: "It could not be judged,
sir," and Slender chuckles: "You'll not confess;
you'll not confess." Why could it not
be judged? For one of the delights of the
Cotswold hunt&mdash;so hunters say&mdash;is the
clear view on this open tableland of the straining
pack. Shakespeare knew well the "gallant
chiding" of the hounds,&mdash;how, when
they "spend their mouths,"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i15">"Echo replies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if another chase were in the skies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here he may have seen his death-pressed
hare, "poor Wat," try to baffle his pursuers
and confuse the scent by running among the
sheep and deer and along the banks "where
earth-delving conies keep."</p>

<p>Still about our route clung, like a silver
mist, Shakespeare traditions. In the now
perished church of Luddington, two miles
south of Stratford, the poet, it is said, married
Anne Hathaway; but the same bridal is
claimed for the venerable church of Temple
Grafton, about a mile distant, and again for
the neighbouring church of Billesley. Long
Marston, "Dancing Marston," believes its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
sporting-ground was in the mind of the prentice
playwright, a little homesick yet in London,
when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Nine-Men's Morris is filled up with mud;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the quaint mazes in the wanton green,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For lack of tread, are undistinguishable."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>At Lower Quinton stands an old manor-house
of whose library&mdash;such is the whisper
that haunts its folios&mdash;Will Shakespeare
was made free. A happy picture that&mdash;of
an eager lad swinging across the fields and
leaping stiles to enter into his paradise of
books.</p>

<p>We were well into Gloucestershire before
this, that tongue of Gloucestershire which
runs up almost to Stratford-on-Avon, and
were driving on in the soft twilight, now past
the old-time Common Fields with their furlongs
divided by long balks; now over rolling
reaches, crossed by low stone walls, of
sheep-walk and water-meadow and wheat-land,
with here and there a fir plantation or
a hazel covert; now through a strange grey
hamlet built of the native limestone. Our
road was gradually rising, and just before
nightfall we came into Chipping Campden,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
most beautiful of the old Cotswold towns. We
had not dreamed that England held its like,&mdash;one
long, wide, stately street, bordered by
silent fronts of great stone houses, with here
and there the green of mantling ivy, but
mainly with only the rich and changeful
colouring of the stone itself, grey in shadow,
golden in the sun. Campden was for centuries
a famous centre of the wool trade; the
Cotswolds served it as a broad grazing-ground
whose flocks furnished wool for the skilful
Flemish weavers; its fourteenth century
Woolstaplers' Hall still stands; its open
market-house, built in 1624 midway of the
mile-long street, is one of its finest features;
its best-remembered name is that of William
Grevel, described on his monumental brass
(1401) as "Flower of the Wool-merchants of
all England." He bequeathed a hundred
marks toward the building of the magnificent
church, which stood complete, as we see
it now, in the early fifteenth century. Its
glorious tower, tall and light, yet not too
slender, battlemented, turreted, noble in all
its proportions, is a Cotswold landmark. As
we were feasting our eyes, after an evening
stroll, upon the symmetries of that grand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
church, wonderfully impressive as it rose in
the faint moonlight above a group of strange,
pagoda-roofed buildings, its chimes rang out
a series of sweet old tunes, all the more
poignantly appealing in that the voices of
those ancient bells were thin and tremulous,
and now and then a note was missed.</p>

<span class="caption">TOWER OF CHIPPING CAMPDEN CHURCH</span>
</div>

<p>The fascinations of Campden held us the
summer day long. We must needs explore
the church interior, which has suffered at the
hands of the restorer; yet its chancel brasses,
wrought with figures of plump woolstaplers,
their decorous and comely dames, and their
kneeling children, reward a close survey. I
especially rejoiced in one complacent burgher,
attended by three wimpled wives, and a long
row of sons and daughters all of the same size.
There is a curious chapel, too, where we came
upon the second Viscount Campden, in marble
shroud and coronet, ceremoniously handing,
with a most cynical and unholy expression,
his lady from the sepulchre. There was a
ruined guildhall to see, and some antique
almshouses of distinguished beauty. As we
looked, an old man came feebly forth and
bowed his white head on the low enclosing
wall in an attitude of grief or prayer. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
learned later that one of the inmates had died
that very hour. We went over the works of
the new Guild of Handicraft, an attempt to
realise, here in the freshness of the wolds, the
ideals of Ruskin and Morris. We cast wistful
eyes up at Dover's Hill, on whose level
summit used to be held at Whitsuntide the
merry Cotswold Games. "Heigh for Cotswold!"
But it was the hottest day of the
summer, and we contented ourselves with
the phrase.</p>

<p>Other famous Cotswold towns are "Stow-on-the-Wold,
where the wind blows cold";
Northleach in the middle of the downs, desolate
now, but once full of the activities of those
wool-merchants commemorated by quaint
brasses in the splendid church,&mdash;brasses
which show them snugly at rest in their furred
gowns, with feet comfortably planted on
stuffed woolpack or the fleecy back of a sheep,
or, more precariously, on a pair of shears;
Burford, whose High Street and church are
as noteworthy as Campden's own; Winchcombe,
once a residence of the Mercian kings
and a famous shrine of pilgrimage; Cirencester,
the "Capital of the Cotswolds," built
above a ruined Roman city and possessing a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
church of surpassing richness. How we
longed for months of free-footed wandering
over these exhilarating uplands with their
grey settlements like chronicles writ in stone!
But Father Time was shaking his hour-glass
just behind us, in his marplot fashion, and
since it had to be a choice, we took the evening
train to Chipping Norton.</p>

<p>I regret to say that Chipping Norton, the
highest town in Oxfordshire, showed little
appreciation of the compliment. It was not
easy to find lodging and wellnigh impossible
to get carriage conveyance back to Campden
the next day. It is a thriving town, ranking
third in the county, and turns out a goodly
supply of leather gloves and the "Chipping
Norton tweeds." The factory folk were,
many of them, having their holiday just then;
their friends were coming for the week-end
and had one and all, it would seem, set their
hearts on being entertained by a Saturday
drive; the only victoria for hire in the place
was going to Oxford to bring an invalid lady
home; altogether the hostlers washed their
hands&mdash;merely in metaphor&mdash;of the two
gad-abouts who thought Chipping Norton
not good enough to spend Sunday in. Before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
we slept, however, we had succeeded in engaging,
at different points, a high wagonette,
a gaunt horse, and a bashful boy, and the combination
stood ready for us at nine o'clock
in the morning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile we had seen the chief sights of
this venerable town, whose name is equivalent
to Market Norton. Its one wide street,
a handsome, tree-shadowed thoroughfare with
the Town Hall set like an island in its midst,
runs up the side and along the brow of a steep
plateau. A narrow way plunges down from
this central avenue and passes a seven-gabled
row of delectable almshouses, dated 1640.
Indeed, no buildings in these Midland counties
have more architectural charm than their
quaint shelters for indigent old age. The
abrupt lane leads to a large grey church,
square-towered and perpendicular, like the
church of Chipping Campden, but with a few
Early English traces. Its peculiar feature is
the glass clerestory,&mdash;great square windows
divided from one another by the pillars of the
nave. The sexton opened the doors for us
so early that we had leisure to linger a little
before the old altar-stone with its five crosses,
before St. Mary's banner bordered with her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
own blue, before the warrior pillowed on his
helmet and praying his last prayer beside his
lady, whose clasped hands, even in the time-worn
alabaster, have a dimpled, chubby,
coaxing look; and before those characteristic
merchant brasses, the men in tunics with
close sleeves and girdles, one of them standing
with each foot on a woolpack, the women
in amazing head-dresses, "horned" and
"pedimented," and all the work so carefully
and elaborately wrought that the Cotswold
brasses are authorities for the costume of the
period.</p>

<span class="caption">THE ROLLRIGHT STONES</span>
</div>

<p>One of the main objects of this expedition,
however, was the drive back over the hills
with their far views of down and wold to
whose vegetation the limestone imparts a
peculiar tint of blue. We deviated from the
Campden road to see the Rollright Stones,
a hoary army with their leader well in advance.
He, the King Stone, is across the
Warwickshire line, but, curiously enough, a
little below the summit which looks out over
the Warwickshire plain. This monolith,
eight or nine feet high, fantastically suggests
a huge body drawn back as if to brace itself
against the fling of some tremendous curse.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
The tale tells how, in those good old times
before names and dates had to be remembered,
a petty chief, who longed to extend his sway
over all Britain, had come thus far on his
northward march. But here, when he was
almost at the crest of the hill, when seven
strides more would have brought him where
he could see the Warwickshire village of
Long Compton on the other side, out popped
an old witch, as wicked as a thorn-bush, with
the cry:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"If Long Compton thou canst see,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King of England thou shalt be."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>On bounded the chief&mdash;what were seven
steps to reach a throne!&mdash;but the wooded
summit, still shutting off his view, rose faster
than he, and again the eldritch screech was
heard:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Rise up, stick! stand still, stone!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">King of England thou shalt be none."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And there he stands to this day, even as the
spell froze him, while the sorceress, disguised
as an elder tree, keeps watch over her victim.
The fairies steal out from a hole in the bank
on moonlight nights and weave their dances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
round him. No matter how securely the
children of the neighbourhood fit a flat stone
over the hole at bedtime, every morning finds
it thrust aside. We would not for the world
have taken liberties with that elfin portal, but
if we had been sure which of the several elder
trees was the witch, we might have cut at her
with our penknives and seen,&mdash;it is averred
by many,&mdash;as her sap began to flow and her
strength to fail, the contorted stone strain and
struggle to free itself from the charm. And
had we seen that, I am afraid we should forthwith
have desisted from our hacking and taken
to our heels. As it was, the place had an
uncanny feel, and we went back into Oxfordshire
some eighty yards to review the main
body of the army,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i12">"a dismal cirque<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Druid stones upon a forlorn moor."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>These mysterious monuments, which in the
day of the Venerable Bede were no less remarkable
than Stonehenge, have been ravaged
by time, but some sixty of them&mdash;their magic
baffles an exact count&mdash;remain. Grey Druid
semblances, heathen to the core, owl-faced,
monkey-faced, they stand in a great, ragged<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
circle, enclosing a clump of firs. Deeply
sunken in the ground, they are of uneven
height; some barely peep above the surface;
the tallest rises more than seven feet; some
lie prone; some bend sideways; all have an
aspect of extreme antiquity, a perforated,
worm-eaten look the reverse of prepossessing.
But our visit was ill-timed. If we had had
the hardihood to climb up to that wind-swept
waste at midnight, we should have seen those
crouching goblins spring erect, join hands and
gambol around in an ungainly ring, trampling
down the thistles and shocking every church
spire in sight. At midnight of All Saints they
make a mad rush down the hillside for their
annual drink of water at a spring below.</p>

<p>The antiquaries who hold that these strange
stones were erected not as a Druid temple, nor
as memorials of victory, nor for the election
and inauguration of primitive kings, but for
sepulchral purposes, rest their case largely on
the Whispering Knights. This third group
is made up of five stones which apparently
once formed a cromlech and may have been
originally covered with a mound. They are
some quarter of a mile behind the circle,&mdash;a
bad quarter of a mile I found it as I struggled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
across the rugged moor knee-deep in rank
clover and other withering weeds. Just before
me would fly up partridges with a startled
whirr, hovering so near in their bewilderment
that I could almost have knocked a few of
them down with my parasol, if that had appealed
to me as a pleasant and friendly thing
to do. For this was a "cover," destined to
give a few of Blake's and Shelley's countrymen
some autumn hours of brutalising sport.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Each outcry of the hunted hare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A fibre from the brain doth tear.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A skylark wounded in the wing;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A cherubim doth cease to sing."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Five Knights lean close together, yet
without touching, enchanted to stone in the
very act of whispering treason against their
ambitious chief. They whisper still under
the elder tree, and often will a lass labouring
in the barley fields slip away from her companions
at dusk to beg the Five Knights to
whisper her an answer to the question of her
heart. I walked back, having hit on a path,
in company with a rustic harvester, whose
conversation was confined to telling me five
times over, in the stubborn, half-scared tone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of superstition, that while the other elders are
laden with white berries, this elder always
bears red; and the collie wagged his tail,
and the donkey wagged his ears, in solemn
confirmation.</p>

<p>The wagonette gathered us in again, and
soon we passed, not far from the fine Elizabethan
mansion known as Chastleton House,
the Four-Shire Stone, a column marking the
meeting-point of Oxfordshire, Warwickshire,
Gloucestershire, and Worcestershire. Our
route lay for a while in Gloucestershire. As
our shy young driver refreshed our skeleton
steed, which had proved a good roadster, with
gruel, that favourite beverage of English
horses, at Moreton-in-the-Marsh, another
little grey stone town with open market-hall,
we noted a building marked P. S. A. and
learned it was a workingman's club, or something
of that nature, and that the cabalistic
initials stood for Pleasant Sunday Afternoon.
We changed horses at Campden, did
our duty by the inevitable cold joints, and
drove up to Fish Inn, with its far outlook,
and thence down into the fertile Vale of
Evesham. We had not been ready to say
with Richard II,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>but we found a new pleasure in the smiling
welcome of gardened Worcestershire. The
charming village of Broadway, beloved of
artists, detained us for a little, and at Evesham,
even more attractive with its beautiful bell-tower,
its Norman gateway and cloister arch&mdash;pathetic
relics of its ruined abbey&mdash;and
with its obelisk-marked battlefield where fell
Simon de Montfort, "the most peerless man
of his time for valour, personage, and wisdom,"
we brought our driving-tour in the
Midlands to a close.</p>

<h2><a name="OXFORD" id="OXFORD"></a>OXFORD</h2>


<p>Shakespeare's frequent horseback
journeys from London to Stratford, and
from Stratford to London, must have
made him familiar with the county of Oxfordshire.
He would have seen its northern uplands
sprinkled over with white-fleeced sheep
of the pure old breed, sheep so large that their
mutton is too fat for modern palates: a
smaller sheep, yielding inferior wool, is fast
supplanting the original Cotswold. He would
not have met upon the downs those once so
frequent passengers, the Flemish merchants
with their trains of sumpter mules and pack-horses,
bound for Chipping Campden or some
other market where wool might be "cheapened"
in the way of bargaining, for by Shakespeare's
day the cloth-making industry in
the valley of the Stroud Water, Gloucestershire,
had attained to such a flourishing condition
that the export of raw material was
forbidden.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not likely that his usual route would
have given him the chance to refresh himself
with Banbury cakes at Banbury and, profane
player that he was, bring down upon himself
a Puritan preachment from Ben Jonson's
Zeal-of-the-land-Busy; but Shakespeare's
way would almost certainly have lain through
Woodstock. This ancient town has royal
traditions reaching back to King Alfred and
Etheldred the Redeless, but these are obscured
for the modern tourist by the heavy
magnificence of Blenheim Palace, the Duke
of Marlborough's reward for his "famous
victory." The legend of Fair Rosamund&mdash;how
Henry II hid her here embowered in a
labyrinth, and how the murderous Queen
Eleanor tracked her through the maze by the
clue of a silken thread&mdash;Shakespeare, like
Drayton, could have enjoyed without molestation
from the critical historian, who now
insists that it was Eleanor whom the king
shut up to keep her from interfering with his
loves. Poor Rosamund! Her romance is
not suffered to rest in peace here any more
than was her fair body in the church of Godstow
nunnery. There she had been buried in
the centre of the choir, and the nuns honoured<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
her grave with such profusion of broidered
hangings and burning tapers as to scandalise
St. Hugh, Bishop of Lincoln, who, on visiting
the nunnery in 1191, gave orders that she be
disinterred and buried "out of the church
with other common people to the end that
religion be not vilified." But after some
years the tender nuns slipped those rejected
bones into a "perfumed leather bag" and
brought them back within the holy pale. The
dramatist, who seems to have done wellnigh
his earliest chronicle-play writing in an episode
of the anonymous "Edward III," may
have remembered, as he rode into the old
town, that the Black Prince was born at
Woodstock. But whether or no he gave a
thought to Edward III's war-wasted heir, he
could hardly have failed to muse upon that
monarch's poet, "most sacred happie spirit,"
Geoffrey Chaucer, whose son Thomas&mdash;if this
Thomas Chaucer were indeed the poet's son&mdash;resided
at Woodstock in the early part of the
fifteenth century. And still fresh would have
been the memory of Elizabeth's imprisonment
in the gate-house during a part of her sister
Mary's reign. It was here, according to
Holinshed, on whom the burden of pronouns<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
rested lightly, that the captive princess "hearing
upon a time out of hir garden at Woodstock
a certaine milkemaid singing pleasantlie
wished herselfe to be a milkemaid as she was,
saieing that hir case was better, and life more
merier than was hirs in that state as she was."</p>

<p>Charles I and the Roundheads had not then
set their battle-marks all over Oxfordshire,
and Henley, now famed for its July regatta
as far as water flows, was still content with
the very moderate speed of its malt-barges;
but Oxford&mdash;I would give half my library to
know with what feelings Shakespeare used to
behold its sublime group of spires and towers
against the sunset sky. This "upstart crow,"
often made to wince under the scorn of those
who, like Robert Greene,&mdash;the red-headed
reprobate!&mdash;could write themselves "Master
of Arts of both Universities," what manner of
look did he turn upon that august town</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"gorgeous with high-built colleges,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And scholars seemly in their grave attire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Learnèd in searching principles of art?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Here in the midst of the valley of the
Thames, Oxford had already kept for centuries
a queenly state, chief city of the shire,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
with a university that ranked as one of the
"two eyes of England." The university,
then as now, was made up of a number of
colleges which owned, by bequest and by purchase,
a considerable portion of the county,
though they by no means limited their estates
to Oxfordshire. Almost all those "sacred
nurseries of blooming youth" which delight
us to-day were known to the dust-stained
traveller who put up, perhaps twice a year,
perhaps oftener, at the Crown Inn, kept by
John Davenant, vintner. Apart from the
painfully modern Keble, a memorial to the
author of "The Christian Year," and the still
more recent roof-trees for dissent, Congregational
Mansfield and Unitarian Manchester,
what college of modern Oxford would be
utterly strange to Shakespeare? Even in
Worcester, an eighteenth-century erection on
the site of the ruined Benedictine foundation
of Gloucester College, search soon reveals
vestiges of the old monastic dwellings. Not
a few of the very edifices that Shakespeare
saw still stand in their Gothic beauty, but in
case of others, as University, which disputes
with Merton the claim of seniority, boasting
no less a founder than Alfred the Great, new<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
buildings have overgrown the old. Some
have changed their names, as Broadgates, to
which was given, eight years after Shakespeare's
death, a name that even in death
he would hardly have forgotten,&mdash;Pembroke,
in honour of William, Earl of Pembroke,
then Chancellor of the University.
Already venerable, as the poet looked upon
them, were the thirteenth-century foundations
of Merton, with its stately tower, its
library of chained folios, its memories of Duns
Scotus; and Balliol, another claimant for the
dignities of the first-born, tracing its origin to
Sir John de Balliol, father of the Scottish king,
remembering among its early Fellows and
Masters John Wyclif the Reformer; and
Hart Hall, where Tyndale was a student, the
Hertford College of to-day; and St. Edmund
Hall, which has been entirely rebuilt. Another
thirteenth-century foundation, St. Alban
Hall, has been incorporated with Merton.</p>

<p>The fourteenth-century colleges, too, would
have worn a weathered look by 1600,&mdash;Exeter
and Oriel and Queen's and New. The
buildings of Exeter have been restored over
and over, but the mediæval still haunts them,
as it haunted Exeter's latest poet, William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
Morris, who loved Oxfordshire so well that
he finally made his home at Kelmscott on the
Upper Thames. Oriel, which, as Shakespeare
would have known, was Sir Walter
Raleigh's college, underwent an extensive
rebuilding in the reign of Charles I. To
Oriel once belonged St. Mary Hall, where Sir
Thomas More studied,&mdash;a wag of a student
he must have been!&mdash;and now, after an independence
of five hundred years, it is part
of Oriel again. Queen's, named in honour
of Philippa, the consort of Edward III, has
so completely changed its outer fashion that
George II's Queen Caroline is perched upon
its cupola, but by some secret of individuality
it is still the same old college of the Black
Prince and of Henry V,&mdash;the college where
every evening a trumpet summons the men
to dine in hall, and every Christmas the Boar's
Head, garnished with the traditionary greenery,
is borne in to the singing of an old-time
carol, and every New Year's Day the bursar
distributes thread and needles among its
unappreciative masculine community with
the succinct advice: "Take this and be
thrifty."</p>

<p>New College, unlike these three, has hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
altered its original fabric. If Shakespeare
smiled over the name borne by a structure
already mossed and lichened by two centuries,
we have more than twice his reason for
smiling; indeed, we have one excuse that he
had not, for we can think of Sydney Smith as
a New College man. Old it is and old it
looks. The very lanes that lead to it, grey
and twisted passages of stone, conduct us
back to the mediæval world. The Virgin
Mary, the Archangel Gabriel, and, no whit
abashed in such high company, Bishop Wykeham,
the Founder, watch us from their storm-worn
niches as we pass under the gateway
into the majestic quadrangle. Here time-blackened
walls hold the gaze enthralled with
their ancientry of battlements and buttresses,
deep-mullioned windows and pinnacle-set
towers. Beyond lie the gardens, still bounded
on two sides by the massive masonry, embrasured,
bastioned, parapeted, of the old City
Wall,&mdash;gardens where it should always be
October, drifty, yellow, dreamy, quiet, with
wan poplars and aspens and chestnuts whispering
and sighing together, till some grotesque
face sculptured on the wall peers out
derisively through ivy mat or crimson creeper,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
and the red-berried hollies, old and gay
with many Christmases, rustle in reassuring
laughter. Meanwhile the rooks flap heavily
among the mighty beeches, whose tremendous
trunks are all misshapen with the gnarls
and knobs of age.</p>

<p>Of the fifteenth-century foundations, All
Souls, "The College of All Souls of the Faithful
Departed," and especially of those who
fell in the French wars, retains much of its
original architecture; in the kitchen of Lincoln,
if not in the chapel, Shakespeare would
still find himself at home; and for him, as for
all the generations since, the lofty tower of
Magdalen rose as Oxford's crown of beauty.
Magdalen College is ancient. The very
speaking of the name (Maudlin) tells us that,
all the more unmistakably because Magdalen
Bridge and Magdalen Street carry the modern
pronunciation. But Magdalen College, with
its springing, soaring grace, its surprises of
delight, its haunting, soul-possessing loveliness,
has all the winning charm of youth. Its
hundred acres of lawn and garden, wood and
park, where deer browse peacefully beneath
the shade of giant elms and where Addison's
beloved Water Walks beside the Cherwell are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
golden with the primroses and daffodils of
March and blue with the violets and periwinkles
of later spring, are even more tempting
to the book-fagged wanderer than Christ
Church Meadow and "Mesopotamia." It is
hard to tell when Magdalen is most beautiful.
It has made the circle of the year its own. On
May Day dawn, all Oxford, drowsy but determined,
gathers in the broad street below
to see&mdash;it depends upon the wind whether
or no one may hear&mdash;the choir chant their
immemorial hymn from the summit of the
tower. When the ending of the rite is made
known to the multitude by the flinging over
of the caps,&mdash;black mortar-boards that sail
slowly down the one hundred and fifty feet
like a flock of pensive rooks,&mdash;then away it
streams over Magdalen Bridge toward Iffley
to gather Arnold's white and purple fritillaries,
and, after a long and loving look at Iffley's
Norman Church, troops home along the
towing-path beside the Isis. Shakespeare
may himself have heard, if he chanced to
be passing through on St. John Baptist's
Day, the University sermon preached from
the curiously canopied stone pulpit well up
on the wall in a corner of one of the quadrangles,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
while the turf was sweet with strewn
rushes and all the buildings glistening with
fresh green boughs. But even in midwinter
Magdalen is beautiful, when along Addison's
Walk the fog is frosted like most delicate
enamel on every leaf and twig, and this
white world of rime takes on strange flushes
from the red sun peering through the haze.</p>

<p>Of the six Tudor foundations, Trinity
occupies the site of Durham College, a thirteenth-century
Benedictine institution suppressed
by Henry VIII; St. John's, closely
allied to the memory of Archbishop Laud, is
the survival of St. Bernard College, which
itself grew out of a Cistercian monastery;
Brasenose, associated for earlier memory with
Foxe of the "Book of Martyrs" and for later
with Walter Pater, supplanted two mediæval
halls; and Jesus College, the first to be
founded after the Reformation, endowed by
a Welshman for the increase of Welsh learning,
received from Elizabeth a site once held
by academic buildings of the elder faith.
Only Corpus Christi, where Cardinal Pole and
Bishop Hooker studied to such different ends,
although it is, as its name indicates, of Catholic
origin, rose on fresh soil and broke with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
the past, with the mediæval educational tradition,
by making regular provision for the systematic
study of Latin and Greek.</p>

<span class="caption">THE TOWER, MAGDALEN COLLEGE</span>
</div>

<p>The great Tudor foundation was Christ
Church, built on the sacred ground where, in
the eighth century, St. Frideswide, a princess
with a pronounced vocation for the religious
life, had erected a nunnery of which she was
first abbess. The nunnery became, after her
death, a house of canons, known as St. Frideswide's
Priory. Cardinal Wolsey brought
about the surrender of this priory to the king,
and its prompt transfer to himself, some fifteen
years before the general Dissolution.
His ambition, not all unrealised, was to found
as his memorial a splendid seat of the New
Learning at Oxford to be called Cardinal's
College. He had gone so far as to erect a
magnificent hall, with fan-vaulted entrance
and carved oak ceiling of surpassing beauty,
a kitchen ample enough to feed the Titans,
"The Faire Gate" and, in outline, the Great
Quadrangle, for whose enlargement he pulled
down three bays of the Priory church, when
his fall cut short his princely projects. His
graceless master attempted to take over to
himself the credit of Wolsey's labours, substituting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
the name of King Henry VIII's
College, but on creating, a few years later, the
bishopric of Oxford, he blended the cathedral
and college foundations as the Church
and House of Christ. The cathedral fabric
is still in the main that of the old Priory
church. Of the several quadrangles, Canterbury
Quad keeps a memory of Canterbury
College, which, with the other Benedictine
colleges, Gloucester and Durham, went down
in the storm. Christ's Church&mdash;"The
House," as its members call it&mdash;is the aristocratic
college of Oxford. Noblemen and
even princes may be among those white-surpliced
figures that flit about the dim quads
after Sunday evensong. Ruskin's father, a
wealthy wine-merchant of refined tastes and
broad intelligence, hesitated to enter his son
as a gentleman commoner at Christ's lest the
act should savour of presumption. Yet no
name has conferred more lustre on "The
House" than that of him who became the
Slade Professor of Fine Arts, waking all Oxford
to nobler life and resigning, at last, because
he could not bear that the university
should sanction vivisection.</p>

<p>Wadham College, though the lovely garden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
with its hoary walls starred by jasmine and its
patriarchal cedars casting majestic shadows&mdash;a
garden that rivals for charm even those
of St. John's and Worcester and Exeter&mdash;has
such a venerable air, is the youngest of all
these. Its first stone was laid, on a site formerly
occupied by a priory of Augustinian
Friars, only six years before Shakespeare's
death. In his later journeys he would not
have failed to note the progress of its
erection.</p>

<p>But if Shakespeare saw, as he rode through
Oxford, almost all the colleges that may now
be seen, he also saw much that has crumbled
away into an irretrievable past. Not only
were the various colleges, halls, priories, and
friaries of the monastic orders still in visible
ruin, but the great abbeys of Osney and of
Rewley, the former one of the largest and
richest in all England, still made the appeal
of a beautiful desolation. No wonder that
Shakespeare compared the naked branches
of autumn, that wintry end of the season</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"bare, ruined choirs."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></div></div>

<p>If, as seems probable, the Arden sympathies
lingered long with the Mother Church,
if Shakespeare did not forget, even in those
closing years when his homeward trips
brought him to a Puritan household and an
ever more Puritan town, the bitter fate of his
kinsmen of Wilmcote and Wootton-Wawen,
he must have been keenly alive to these ravages
of the Reformation. Yet he had been some
twenty years at the vortex of Elizabethan life,
in the very seethe of London; he had witnessed
many a wrong and many a tragedy;
he was versed to weariness of heart in the
"hostile strokes" that befall humanity, in all
the varied</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i18">"throes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In life's uncertain voyage";<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and he knew, no man better, that Right is not
of one party, nor Truth of a single creed. He
must have mused, as he took the air in Oxford
streets after Mistress Davenant had served his
supper, on the three great Protestant Martyrs
of whose suffering some of the elder folk with
whom he chatted had been eyewitnesses.
The commemorative cross that may now be
seen in front of Balliol, near the church of St.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
Mary Magdalen whose tower was a familiar
sight to Shakespeare's eyes, displays in richly
fretted niches the statues of "Thomas Cranmer,
Nicolas Ridley, Hugh Latimer, Prelates
of the Church of England, who near this spot
yielded their bodies to be burned." Most of
all, his thought would have dwelt on Cranmer,
that pathetic figure whose life was such a
mingled yarn of good and evil. He had won
the favour of Henry VIII by approving the
divorce of Queen Catherine. He had beheld&mdash;and
in some cases furthered&mdash;the downfalls
of Sir Thomas More, of Anne Boleyn, of
Wolsey, of Cromwell, of Catherine Howard,
of Seymour, and of Somerset. He had stood
godfather to Elizabeth and to Edward. He
had watched over the death-bed of the tyrant;
he had crowned that tyrant's frail young son
as Edward VI. When by his adherence to
the cause of Lady Jane Grey he had incurred
sentence of treason, he was pardoned
by Queen Mary. Yet this pardon only
amounted to a transfer from the Tower of
London to the Bocardo in Oxford, that prison-house
over the North Gate from whose stone
cells used to come down the hoarse cry of
cold and hunger: "Pity the Bocardo birds."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
There were those still living in Oxford who
could have told the dramatist, as he gazed up
through the moonlight (for who does not?) to
the pinnacled spire of St. Mary-the-Virgin,
all the detail of those April days, only ten
years before his birth, when Cranmer, with
Ridley and Latimer, was brought into the
church and bidden, before a hostile assemblage
of divines, to justify the heresies of the
new prayer-book. On the Tuesday Cranmer
pleaded from eight till two; Ridley was heard
on the Wednesday, and on the Thursday the
aged Latimer, a quaint champion as he stood
there "with a kerchief and two or three caps
on his head, his spectacles hanging by a string
at his breast, and a staff in his hand." On
the Friday all three were condemned. After
a year and a half of continued confinement,
Archbishop Cranmer, whose irresolution was
such that, from first to last, he wrote seven
recantations, was made to look out from his
prison window upon the tormented death of
his friends. Then it was that the stanch old
Latimer, bowed with the weight of fourscore
years, but viewing the fagots undismayed,
spake the never-forgotten words: "Be of
good comfort, Master Ridley. We shall this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
day light such a candle, by God's grace, in
England, as I trust shall never be put out."
Cranmer's own end came six months later,
on March 21, 1556. He was first brought to
St. Mary's that he might publicly abjure his
heresies. But at that desperate pass, no
longer tempted by the hope of life,&mdash;for hope
there was none,&mdash;his manhood returned to
him with atoning dignity and force. Prison-wasted,
in ragged gown, a man of sixty-seven
years, he clearly avowed his Protestant faith,
declaring that he had penned his successive
recantations in fear of the pains of death, and
adding: "Forasmuch as my hand offended
in writing contrary to my heart, my hand
therefore shall be first punished; for if I may
come to the fire, it shall be the first burnt."
And having so "flung down the burden of his
shame," he put aside those who would still
have argued with him and fairly ran to the
stake,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Outstretching flameward his upbraided hand."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The university church, this beautiful St.
Mary's, has other memories. From its pulpit
Wyclif proclaimed such daring doctrines that
Lincoln College was founded to refute them,&mdash;Lincoln,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
which came to number among
its Fellows John Wesley and to shelter those
first Methodist meetings, the sessions of his
"Holy Club." In St. Mary's choir rests the
poor bruised body of Amy Robsart. The
spiral-columned porch was erected by Laud's
chaplain, and its statue of the Virgin and
Child so scandalised the Puritans that they
pressed it into service for one of their articles
of impeachment directed against the doomed
archbishop.</p>

<p>What could the thronging student life of
Oxford have meant to the author of "Hamlet"?
Of his careless young teachers in
stage-craft&mdash;so soon his out-distanced rivals&mdash;Lyly
and Peele and Lodge would have
been at home beside the Isis and the Cherwell,
as Greene and Nash and Marlowe by the
Cam; but Shakespeare&mdash;did those fluttering
gowns, those gaudy-hooded processions,
stir in him more than a stranger's curiosity?
The stern day of that all-learned Master of
Balliol, Dr. Jowett, who stiffened examinations
to a point that would have dismayed
Shakespeare's contemporaries, save, perhaps,
the redoubtable Gabriel Harvey, was still in
the far future; the magnificent New Schools,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
with their dreaded <i>viva voces</i>, had not yet
come; the Rhodes Scholarships were beyond
the dream-reach of even a Raleigh or a
Spenser; but academic tests and academic
pomps there were. The Old Schools Quadrangle,
not quite complete, had been building
in a leisurely way since 1439 and was in
regular use, though the Divinity School,
whose arched, groined, boss-studded roof is
one of the beauties of Oxford, had nearly suffered
wreck, in the brief reign of Edward VI,
at the hands of that class of theological reformers
who have a peculiar aversion to
stained glass. The exercises of the <i>Encaenia</i>
Shakespeare would have heard, if he ever
chanced to hear them, in St. Mary's, but half
a century after his death they were transferred
to the new Sheldonian Theatre. In
St. Mary's, which was not only "Learning's
receptacle" but also "Religion's parke," these
exercises, the <i>Acts</i>, naturally took the form
of disputations concerning "wingy mysteries
in divinity." When they passed out from the
church to an unconsecrated edifice, political
and social themes, still treated in scholastic
Latin, were added, but even so the entertainment
was of the dullest. Professional fun-makers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
successors of the mediæval minstrels,
had to be called in to enliven the occasion with
a peppering of jests, but these became so
scurrilous that the use of hired buffoons
was forbidden by Convocation. Then the
resourceful undergraduates magnanimously
came forward, volunteering to take this delicate
duty upon themselves, and manfully have
they discharged it to this day. These young
Oxonians have developed the normal undergraduate
gift for sauce into an art that even
knows the laws of proportion and restraint.
The limits allowed them are of the broadest,
but only twice in living memory has their
mischief gone so far as to break up the
assemblage.</p>

<p>The threefold business of the annual <i>Encaenia</i>
is to confer honorary degrees, to listen
to the prize compositions, and to hear an address
delivered by the Public Orator in commemoration
of Founders and Benefactors,
with comment on current events. On the
one occasion when I was privileged to be
present, the hour preceding the entrance of
the academic procession was the liveliest of all.
The lower galleries were reserved for guests,
but the upper, the Undergraduates' Gallery,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
was packed with students in cap and gown,
who promptly began to badger individuals
chosen at whim from the throng of men
standing on the floor.</p>

<p>"I don't like your bouquet, sir. It's too
big for your buttonhole. If the lady wouldn't
mind&mdash;"</p>

<p>The offending roses disappeared in a general
acclaim of "Thank you, sir," and the
cherubs aloft pounced on another victim.
The unfortunates so thrust into universal
notice usually complied with the request,
whatever it might be, as quickly as possible,
eager to escape into obscurity, but a certain
square-jawed Saxon wearing a red tie put up
a stubborn resistance until all the topmost
gallery was shouting at him, and laughing
faces were turned upon him from every
quarter of the house.</p>

<p>"Take off that red tie, sir."</p>

<p>"Indeed, sir, you don't look pretty in it."</p>

<p>"It doesn't go well with your blushes."</p>

<p>"<i>Will</i> you take off that tie, sir?"</p>

<p>"It's not to our cultured taste, sir."</p>

<p>"It's the only one he's got."</p>

<p>"Dear sir, <i>please</i> take it off."</p>

<p>"It gives me the eye-ache, sir."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Have you paid for it yet?"</p>

<p>"Was there anybody in the shop when you
bought it?"</p>

<p>"Are you wearing it for an advertisement?"</p>

<p>"Hush-h! <i>She</i> gave it to him."</p>

<p>"Oh, SHE put it on for him."</p>

<p>"You're quite right, sir. Don't take it
off."</p>

<p>"We can sympathize with young romance,
sir."</p>

<p>"Be careful of it, sir."</p>

<p>"Wear it till your dying day."</p>

<p>"It's the colour of her hair."</p>

<p>But by this time the poor fellow's face was
flaming, and he jerked off the tie and flung
it to the floor amid thunders of derisive
applause.</p>

<p>Then the Undergraduate Gallery turned
its attention to the organist, who in all the
hubbub was brilliantly going through the
numbers of his program.</p>

<p>"Will you kindly tell us what you're playing,
Mr. Lloyd?"</p>

<p>"We don't care for classical music ourselves."</p>

<p>"'Auld Lang Syne,' if you please."</p>

<p>The organ struck into "Auld Lang Syne,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
and the lads sprang up and sang it lustily with
hands clasped in the approved Scotch fashion.</p>

<p>"'Rule, Britannia,' Mr. Lloyd."</p>

<p>Again he obliged them and was rewarded
by a rousing cheer, followed by cheers for the
Varsity and the ladies, groans for the Proctors,
who are the officers of discipline, and barks
for their assistants, the so-called Bulldogs.
In the midst of this yelping chorus the great
doors were flung wide, and an awesome file
of dignitaries, in all the blues and purples,
pinks and scarlets, of their various degrees,
paced slowly up the aisle, escorting their distinguished
guests, savants of several nations,
and headed by the Vice-Chancellor, whose
array outwent Solomon in all his glory.</p>

<p>The top gallery was on its feet, but not in
reverence. The organ-march was drowned
in the roar of lusty voices greeting the Head
of the University thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Oh, whist, whist, whist!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here comes the bogie man.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now go to bed, you Baby,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">You Tommy, Nell, and Dan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Oh, whist, whist, whist!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">He'll catch ye if he can;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all the popsies, wopsies, wop,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Run for the bogie man."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span></div></div>

<p>The uproar was no whit diminished when
presently the Vice-Chancellor was seen to be
making an address.</p>

<p>"Who wrote it for you, sir?"</p>

<p>"Oh, that's shocking bad Latin."</p>

<p>"<i>Jam!</i> What kind of jam?"</p>

<p>"It's just what you said to those other
blokes last year."</p>

<p>"It's always the same thing."</p>

<p>"It's all blarney."</p>

<p>"The guests wish you were done, sir."</p>

<p>"You may sit down, sir."</p>

<p>But the Vice-Chancellor, unperturbed, kept
on with his inaudible oratory to its natural
end.</p>

<p>A professor of illustrious name was next
to rise, throwing up a laughing look at the
boys, whose tumult bore him down after the
first few sentences. What matter? It was
idle to pretend that that great audience could
follow Latin speeches. They were all to go
into print, and he who would and could might
read them at his ease. The phrase that undid
this genial personage was <i>clarior luce</i>.</p>

<p>"Oh, <i>oh</i>, sir! Lucy who?"</p>

<p>"Clare or Lucy? Try for both, sir."</p>

<p>"We'll surely tell your wife, sir."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>"A sad example to our youth, sir."</p>

<p>"You shock our guest from Paris, sir."</p>

<p>The prize English essayist was hardly
allowed to recite the first paragraph of his
production.</p>

<p>"Very nice."</p>

<p>"But a great bore."</p>

<p>"It's not as good as mine."</p>

<p>"That'll do, sir."</p>

<p>"The Vice-Chancellor is gaping, sir."</p>

<p>"Three cheers for the lady who jilted the
Senior Proctor!"</p>

<p>Under the storm of enthusiasm evoked by
this happy suggestion, the English essayist
gave place to the Greek poet, a rosy-cheeked
stripling who stood his ground barely two
minutes.</p>

<p>"Aren't you very young, my dear?"</p>

<p>"Will some kind lady kiss him for his
mother?"</p>

<p>The English prize poem, the Newdigate,
founded by Sir Roger Newdigate of the
George Eliot country, was heard through
with a traditional attention and respect,
though the poet's delivery came in for occasional
criticism.</p>

<p>"You're too singsong, sir."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Please give him the key, Mr. Lloyd."</p>

<p>Even those few world-famed scholars and
statesmen on whom the University was conferring
the high distinction of her D. C. L.
were showered with merry impudence, as one
by one they advanced to receive the honour,
though there were no such lucky shots of wit
as have signalised, on different occasions, at
Oxford or at Cambridge, the greeting of certain
popular poets. Holmes was asked from
the gallery if he had come in the one-hoss shay,
and Longfellow, wearing the gorgeous vestments
of his new dignity, was hailed by a cry:
"Behold the Red Man of the West." Even
the Laureate, whose prophet locks were flung
back from his inspired brow somewhat more
wildly than their wont, was assailed by a
stentorian inquiry:</p>

<p>"<i>Did</i> your mother call you early, call you
early, Alfred dear?"</p>

<p>The conferring of degrees upon Oxford
students takes place&mdash;at irregular intervals,
but not infrequently&mdash;in the Convocation
House. Into a long, narrow room, dignitaries
grouped at the top and candidates at
the bottom, with guests seated in rows on
either side, sweeps the Vice-Chancellor in his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
gorgeous red and white. He is preceded by
the mace-bearer and followed by two Proctors.
Taking the place of honour, he reads a page
or two of Latin, lifting his cap&mdash;the Proctors
raising theirs in solemn unison&mdash;whenever
the word <i>Dominus</i> occurs. The lists of candidates
for the various degrees are then read,
and the Proctors, at the end of each list, rise
simultaneously, march a few steps down the
hall, wheel with military precision, and, like
the King of France, march back again. These
apparently wayward promenades are supposed
to give opportunity for tradesmen with
unpaid bills to imperil a candidate's degree
by plucking the Proctor's gown. The Oxford
tradesmen have not availed themselves
of this privilege for a century or so, but the
term <i>plucked</i> is only too familiar. With many
bows and much Latin, even with kneeling that
the Vice-Chancellor may tap the learned pates
with a Testament, the higher degrees are conferred.
Each brand-new doctor withdraws
into the robing-room, where his waiting friends
eagerly divest him of his old plumage and
trick him out in gayer hood and more voluminous
gown. So arrayed, he returns for a low
bow to the Vice-Chancellor, who touches his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
own mortar-board in response. The larger
company of candidates for the first degree
come forward in groups, each head of a college
presenting his own men, and these are
speedily made into bachelors.</p>

<p>Out of that student multitude have come&mdash;not
all, be it confessed, with degrees&mdash;many
of England's greatest. Glorious phantoms
haunt by moonlight the Gothic shadows
of High Street. The gallant Lovelace, the
resolute Pym, Admiral Blake, Sir Philip Sidney,
Francis Beaumont, Lord Herbert of
Cherbury, Sir Thomas Browne, Dr. Johnson,
Dean Swift, Wellington, Peel, Gladstone,
Adam Smith, Hamilton, Locke, Hobbes,
Blackstone, Newman, Manning, Stanley,
Maurice, Faber, Heber, Clough, Jeremy
Taylor, Whitfield, the Wesleys, the Arnolds,&mdash;and
this is but the beginning of a tale that
can never be told. Yet Oxford, "Adorable
Dreamer" though she be,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Still nursing the unconquerable hope,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>has not done as well by her poets as by the
rest of her brood. With all her theology,
she did not make a churchman out of Swinburne,
nor a saint of Herrick, and as for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
Landor and Shelley, her eyes were holden
and she cast them forth.</p>

<p>Of Shakespeare, an alien figure crossing
the path of her gowned and hooded doctors,
or watching her "young barbarians all at
play"&mdash;for Oxford lads knew how to play
before ever "Eights Week" was thought
of&mdash;she seems to have remembered nothing
save that he stood godfather to his landlady's
baby-boy, little William Davenant, in the old
Saxon church of St. Michael's. Oxford let
him pay his reckoning at the Crown and go
his way unnoted. He was none of hers.
Even now, when his name is blazoned on
rows upon rows of volumes in window after
window of Broad Street, I doubt if the Oxford
dons would deem Shakespeare capable
of editing his own works.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"Where were you bred?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And how achieved you these endowments, which<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You make more rich to owe?"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>One would like to fancy that Duke Humphrey's
library, beautiful as a library of
Paradise, made the poet welcome; but the
King's Commissioners had despoiled it in
1550, and more than half a century went by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
before, toward the close of Shakespeare's
life, Sir Thomas Bodley had refounded and
refitted it as The Bodleian.</p>

<p>Yet the grey university city, "spreading
her gardens to the moonlight, and whispering
from her towers the last enchantments
of the Middle Age,"&mdash;how could she have
failed deeply to impress the sensitive spirit
of that disregarded wayfarer? Although she
had suffered so grievously under the flail
of the Reformation, although she was destined
to become the battered stronghold of
Charles I, the voice within her gates was,
and is, not the battle-cry, but the murmurous
voice of meditation and dream and prayer.
As we enter into the sanctuary of her grave
beauty, personal chagrins and the despair
of our own brief mortality fall away. The
unending life of human thought is here,
enduring, achieving, advancing, with its constant
miracle of resurrection out of the old
form into the new.</p>

<h2><a name="COUNTIES_OF_THE_SEVERN" id="COUNTIES_OF_THE_SEVERN"></a>COUNTIES OF THE SEVERN
VALLEY</h2>


<p>Of the counties occupying the Severn
basin, three form, in continuation
with Cheshire, the Welsh border,&mdash;Shropshire,
Hereford, and Monmouth. Shropshire,
together with the West Midland counties
of Worcester and Gloucester, is traversed by
the mother stream, but Hereford and Monmouth
lie in their respective vales of the tributary
Wye and Usk, and Warwickshire, already
noted, in the broad basin of the Avon.</p>

<p>In previous summers we had explored, to
some extent, Gloucestershire and Worcestershire
and the picturesque Wye valley, but
we were, except for glimpses from the railway,
strangers to Shropshire, and so dropped
off the train at Shrewsbury, in a Saturday
twilight, with but moderate expectation.
Had not the judicious Baedeker instructed
us that "not more than half a day need be
devoted to Shrewsbury"? What happened
was that we lost our hearts to the beautiful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
old town and lingered there nearly a week
without finding time, even so, to do a third
of the tourist duty laid down in what a guileless
Florentine has called "the red prayer-book
of the foreigners." But we would
gladly have stayed months longer and listened
for the moonlight talk between that lofty
Norman castle, "builte in such a brave
plot that it could have espyed a byrd flying
in every strete," and those fine old houses of
the Salop black-and-white whose "curious
sculptures and carvings and quirks of architecture"
gave such pleasure to Hawthorne.
Surely here, in this city of many memories,
"a stone shall cry out of the wall, and the
beam out of the timber shall answer it."</p>

<p>Shrewsbury is but a little city,&mdash;one of the
local proverbs runs: "We don't go by size, or
a cow would catch a hare,"&mdash;but its architectural
grace and a certain joyousness of open-air
life more French than English endow it
with rare charm. It won a fitting praise from
its own Tudor poet, Thomas Churchyard:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Now Shrewsbury shall be honoured (as it ought);<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The seate deserves a righte greate honour heere;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That wallèd town is sure so finely wrought,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">It glads itself, and beautifies the sheere."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Fortunate in situation, Shrewsbury is enthroned
upon twin hills almost surrounded
by the Severn. As one of the warders of the
Welsh border, it was stoutly fortified, and
enough of the old wall remains to make a
pleasant promenade. On the only land approach,
an isthmus barely three hundred
yards broad, stands the square red keep of
the castle. The slender spire of St. Mary's
is a landmark far and wide. St. Alkmund's,
with a sister spire, has a tradition that
reaches back to Æthelfreda, daughter of
Alfred the Great. Old St. Chad's, a noble
church in the days of Henry III, has swayed
and sunk into a fragment that serves as
chapel for the cemetery where some of the
first Salopian families take their select repose.
The towered Abbey Church is of venerable
dignity, with battered monuments of cross-legged
knight and chaliced priest, and a
meek, bruised, broken effigy supposed to
represent that fiery founder of the abbey,
first Earl of Shrewsbury and builder of
the castle, Roger de Montgomery, second
in command at Hastings to William the
Conqueror.</p>

<span class="caption">THE SEVERN BELOW THE QUARRY, SHREWSBURY</span>
</div>

<p>The first known name of Shrewsbury was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
The Delight, and by that name it may well
be remembered of those who have wandered
through Wyle Cop and Butchers' Row, past
the Raven tavern where Farquhar wrote
"The Recruiting Officer" and the old half-timbered
house where Richmond, soon to
be Henry VII, lodged on his way to Bosworth
Field. There are steep streets that, as the
proverb has it, go "uphill and against the
heart," but carven gables and armorial bearings
and mediæval barge-boards tempt one
on. There are wild and fierce associations,
as that of the Butter Market, where at the
High Cross poor Prince David of Wales&mdash;who
must have had nine lives&mdash;after being
dragged through the town at a horse's tail,
was "hanged, burned and quartered," but
in the main it is a city of gracious memories.
Its Grammar School, an Edward VI foundation,
which in the seventeenth century boasted
four masters, six hundred scholars, and a
"hansome library," counts on its roll of
alumni Charles Darwin, the most famous
native of Shrewsbury, the poet Faber, Philip
Sidney and his <i>fidus Achates</i>, Fulke Greville,
whose tomb in St. Mary's Church at Warwick
bears the inscription that he was "Servant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
to Queen Elizabeth, Counsellour to
King James, and Friend to Sir Philip Sidney."
It was in 1564, that starry year in
English literary annals, that the two lads
entered the school. Sidney's father was then
Lord President of Wales&mdash;one of the best
she ever had&mdash;and resident at Ludlow
Castle, from whose splendid halls Sir Henry
and Lady Mary wrote most wise and tender
letters to their "little Philip." He must
have profited by these, for in after years
Fulke Greville extolled him as the paragon
of schoolboys:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Of his youth I will report no other wonder than
this, though I lived with him and knew him from a
child, yet I never knew him other than a man, with
such staidness of mind, lovely and familiar gravity,
as carried grace and reverence above great years; his
talk ever of knowledge and his very play tending to
enrich his mind so that even his teachers found
something in him to observe and learn above that
which they had usually read or taught."</p></blockquote>

<p>The school, still flourishing, is now housed
in new buildings across the Severn, opposite
the Quarry, a spacious park with</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Broad ambrosial aisles of lofty limes."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></div></div>

<p>Here we used to sit on shaded benches and
watch the bright-eyed urchins fishing in the
river, for Shropshire, as the saying goes, is
"full of trouts and tories." Here we would
repeat Milton's invocation to the Goddess of
the Severn:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sabrina fair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Listen where thou art sitting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under the glassy, cool, translucent wave,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In twisted braids of lilies knitting<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The loose train of thy amber-dropping hair,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and when her "sliding chariot" declined to
stay for us</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By the rushy-fringèd bank,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>we would ignobly console ourselves with "a
Shrewsbury cake of Palin's own make,"&mdash;such
a delicious, melting-on-the-tongue concoction
as Queen Bess was regaled withal and
as suggested to Congreve, in his "Way of the
World," the retort: "Why, brother Wilful of
Salop, you may be as short as a Shrewsbury
cake, if you please." The Simnel cake of
which Herrick sings,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"I'll to thee a Simnel bring,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Gainst thou goest a mothering,"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span></div></div>

<p>is made only in the days approaching Christmas
and Easter. It consists of minced fruit
in a saffron-coloured crust, said to be exceeding
tough, and on Mothering Sunday, in Mid-Lent,
is taken as a gift to their mothers by
children out at service, who, on this local
festival, come home to be welcomed at the
cost of the fatted calf, veal and rice-pudding
being the regulation dinner. The ancient
refrain: "A soule-cake, a soule-cake! Have
mercy on all Christen soules for a soule-cake!"
refers to yet another specialty of
Shropshire ovens. On All Souls' Eve it used
to be the custom to set out on the table a tower
of these round flat cakes, every visitor reducing
the pile by one. The residue, if residue
there were, fell to the share of the poor
ghosts.</p>

<p>The Quarry, in the bad old times, was often
the scene of bull-baitings and bear-baitings
and cock-fights. It is better to remember
that the Whitsun Plays were performed here,
for these were comely and edifying spectacles.
In 1568, when Sir Henry Sidney favoured the
Grammar School with a visit, there was "a
noble stage playe played at Shrewsbury, the
which was praysed greately, and the chyffe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
actor thereof was one Master Aston," being
no less a personage than the head master.</p>

<p>A Quarry holiday that, by the grace of
Sabrina, fell within the brief limits of our
sojourn, was the Shrewsbury Floral Fête,
vaunted on the pink program as "The Grandest
Fête in the United Kingdom." Our landlady
earnestly vouched for the truth of this
description. "There is them who would have
it as York Gala be the greatest, but York
Gala, grand however, ben't so grand as
this."</p>

<p>On Wednesday, August twenty-second, we
took aristocratic tickets at two and six, for
Wednesday is the day of the county families.
Thursday is the shilling day, when, by train,
by coach, by barge, by wagonette, by farmer's
gig and carrier's cart, all the countryside
comes streaming in. The weather had been
watched with keen anxiety. "Rain spells
ruin," the saying went; but it was clear and
hot. Men, women, and children lay on the
grass around their luncheon baskets&mdash;we
had hardly expected this of the county families&mdash;all
through the wide enclosure, making
the most of every disk of shade. From
the central bandstand and from the encircling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
tents&mdash;refreshment tents, flower tents, fruit
tents, vegetable tents, bee-and-honey tents&mdash;drooped
rows of languid pennons. The fountain
in The Dingle sent up a silvery tree of
spray, while the white and yellow water-lilies
in its little pool blinked like sleepy children.
Within the tents the heat was stifling, but a
continuous flow of flushed humanity, as whist
as in the County Store where even the awed
shop girls are instructed to speak with bated
breath, passed in admiring review the sumptuous
masses of heavily fragrant flowers, the
great black grapes almost bursting with wine,
the luscious plums and cherries, the amazing
platoons of plethoric onions, exaggerated potatoes,
and preposterously elongated turnips
and carrots, the model beehives and the jars
of amber honey. The gold-medal exhibitors,
perspiring but beaming, stood by their red-ticketed
products, while the silver-medal folk
viewed their blue tickets with a pleasant sense
of superiority to the subdued white-ticket battalion
and the invisible yellow-ticketers who
were only "commended."</p>

<p>All the while successive bands&mdash;the Shropshire
Imperial Yeomanry, His Majesty's
Coldstream Guards, and His Majesty's Scots<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Guards&mdash;were merrily playing away, and
presently the clamorous ringing of what might
have been a sturdy dinner-bell called us to the
Acrobatic Stand, about which the crowd soon
became so dense, while the somersault artists
converted their bodies into giddy playthings,
that one rustic philosopher was heard to remark:
"Well, we ain't seeing owt, but we're
in t' show." Then came the horse-leaping,
which was such a favourite feature that not
even the miraculous performances of the
King of the High Wire, and the ether-dancing
feats of the Cee Mee Troupe availed to divide
the multitude. When Rufus, to the deep but
decorous delight of the Cheshire visitors, had
outleaped all the rest, we swarmed across the
Quarry and sat down on the grass to wait for
the ascent of the monster balloons, those
gigantic golden-brown puffs of gas that had
been softly tugging at their bonds all the
morning. The Shrewsbury had already
made a number of captive ascents and finally
achieved its "right away" in good order, rising
majestically into the upper air until it
hung like an orange on our furthest reach of
vision, but the wayward Wulfruna broke her
ropes on a captive trip and feloniously made<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
off with several astonished passengers, among
whose vanishing heads peered out the scared,
ecstatic face of a small boy.</p>

<p>As dusk grew on, our ever-greatening host
still comported itself with well-bred English
quietude. We never forgot what was due
to the presence of the county families. Even
the lads in Eton jackets tripped one another
up softly and engagingly. Bath chairs and
baby wagons traversed the thick of the press.
The King of the High Wire, who seemed to
be made of air and india-rubber, appeared
again and performed such impossible antics
on his dizzy line that the setting sun rested its
chin on the horizon to stare at him, and from
a slit in the gaudy trapeze tent half-chalked
visages peered out and paid him the professional
tribute of envy. The tumblers
tumbled more incredibly than before. The
Handcuff King shuffled off one mortal coil
after another. The Lady Cyclists cycled in
an extremely unladylike manner,&mdash;a performance
punctuated by the impatient yelping
of little dogs beneath the stage, eager
to show off their own accomplishments.
On they came at last, bounding, barking,
wagging, tumultuous, all striving to take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
part in every trick. They quite refused
to stop when their respective turns were
over, but went on all together excitedly
jumping rope and hitting ball long after
ropes and balls had disappeared, until they
were unceremoniously picked up and bundled
down a trap-door, an exit of wagging
tail-tips.</p>

<p>As darkness fell, the Severn was all astir
with pleasure-boats, while happy ragamuffins,
getting their fireworks for nothing, thronged
the further bank. Rockets went skittering
over our heads, fire-wheels spluttered and
whizzed, and as the first of the fire-balloons
flashed up, a baby voice behind us piped:</p>

<p>"O mummy, mummy! See! There's
a somebody died and going up to heaven."</p>

<p>Altogether the Floral Fête was as sweet-natured
and pleasurable a festival as ever we
chanced upon and completed our subjugation
to this old town that the Severn so
lovingly embraces. To quote from a black-letter
ballad treasured in the Bodleian:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The merry Town of Shrowsbury<br /></span>
<span class="i2">God bless it still,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For it stands most gallantly<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Upon a high hill.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">It standeth most bravely<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For all men to see.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Then every man to his mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shrowsbury for me!"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The county of Shropshire smooths away
on the east into a level pasture-land belonging
to the central plain of England, but its western
portion is roughened by the spurs of the Welsh
mountains. Its own mountain is the Wrekin,
a solitary height a few miles to the east of
Shrewsbury. The summit commands so
wide a view that the toast of Salopians everywhere
is "All round the Wrekin." South of
the Severn run several ranges of hills down
toward the hop-gardens and apple-orchards
of Hereford and Worcester. Of these, "Clee
Hills," the highest of the ranges, "be holy in
Shropshire."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> North Salop has a coal-field,
with its accompanying prosperity and disfigurement,&mdash;busy
factories, belching furnaces,
houses that tip and tumble from the
hollowing out of the ground beneath. We
rioted in our memorable motor car through
several of these grimy towns, Wellington
among them, and Newport, where the runaway
Shrewsbury balloon came safely down.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>Wellington cherishes a legend relating to a
bad old giant of Wales, who, having a spite
against the Mayor of Shrewsbury, purposed to
choke up the Severn and drown out the town.
So he started off with a heavy sack of earth
over his shoulder, but lost his way, like the
stupid giant he was, and met, near Wellington,
a cobbler carrying home a bag of boots
and shoes to mend. The giant asked him
how far it was to Shrewsbury, and the cobbler,
emptying his sack of ragged footwear, declared
he had worn out all those boots and
shoes on the road. This so discouraged the
giant that he flung down his burden of earth,
forming the Wrekin, and trudged meekly
home again.</p>

<p>Far more delightful than automobiling
were the leisurely drives we took in the neighbourhood
of Shrewsbury. One fair afternoon
we drove five miles southeast to
Wroxeter to view the tragic ruins of the Roman
city of Uriconium. Here, at the junction
of Watling Street with the western
Roman road, guarding these communications
and the passes of the Severn, stood "The
White Town in the Woodland." After the Roman
armies were withdrawn, it was stormed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
and burned by the Saxons. The lapse of
fourteen hundred years has not obliterated
the traces of that anguish. Only a little below
the surface lies earth still black from
the heats of the tremendous conflagration;
charred bones crackle beneath the tread; in
an under-chamber of one of the baths has
been found the skeleton of an old man
crouched between the pillars, as if seeking
refuge from the rage of fire and sword. The
skeletons of two women were beside him and,
close to his bony hand, his little hoard of
coins. There still stands a rugged mass of
wall some seventy feet in length, its Roman
string-courses of flat red bricks showing
bright against the prevailing grey of that
jagged, gaping structure. Now birds nest in
it, and from the lower heaps and ranges of
broken masonry all about springs the wild
rose as well as the thistle. Uriconium was
larger than Pompeii, and its ruins, said to
be the most extensive of their kind in
England, smite one with heartache. We
roamed about its grassy hollows and thicketed
mounds, its bone-strewn forum, and its baths
with their patches of mosaic flooring, their
groups of little brick columns, and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
fragments of a perished luxury. We wondered
that the sky above this city left so
desolate, a sky of softest azure flecked with
cloudlets dazzling white, did not wear perpetual
shadow for its sake. But those
heavens were as serene as if the dying wail
of Uriconium had never pierced them, and
the cleft summit of Milton's "blue-topped
Wrekin"&mdash;a deep, intense, gleaming blue
it was that afternoon&mdash;kept no memory of
the day when the Severn ran red with blood
and its own head was veiled with smoke and
ashes.</p>

<p>The noble Norman church of Wroxeter,
near by, has set at its churchyard gate two
Roman pillars with finely sculptured capitals
that have been recovered from the river-bed.
Its font is hollowed out of another Roman
capital and looks only half converted. The
church is remarkable for its Easter sepulchre,
an arched niche in the north wall of the chancel,
and for its altar-tombs. This Easter
sepulchre, where the crucifix would have been
placed on Good Friday to be raised again
with rejoicing on Easter morning, is of creamy
stone with ball-flower ornament. Within the
niche are reddish traces of a Resurrection<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
fresco. The effigies on the altar-tombs have
been singularly preserved from mutilation.
Even the rings upon those comely hands that
clasp their prayer-books in the centuried
trance of their devotions remain intact. Here
sleeps a Jacobean baronet splendid in scarlet
alabaster robes and broad gilt chain. A peacock
is at his head and a lion's claw at his
feet. His lady, from gold head-dress to
dainty shoon, is no less immaculate. May
their rest on their stone pillows be forever unprofaned!
In that hushed and almost forgotten
sanctuary slumber also Elizabethan
knights and ladies whose tombs, wrought
about with quaint figures, are peculiarly individual
and tempted us to closer study than
the waning light allowed.</p>

<p>There were many pilgrimages we longed
to make in Shropshire&mdash;to the birthplace and
burial-place of Lord Clive, her Indian hero,
and to the home of Lord Herbert of Chirbury,
brother of the Saintly George Herbert, himself
a Jacobean courtier only less eminent in letters
than in life. Even bluff Ben Jonson hailed
him as "All-virtuous Herbert." Other Shropshire
worthies, who would hardly so have
designated each other, are Richard Baxter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
and William Wycherley. Two others that I
would like, in the interests of a broader
charity, to pair together in the procession
of great Salopian ghosts, are Bishop Percy of
the "Reliques," and Dick Tarlton, lord of
mirth, the best-beloved clown of the Elizabethan
stage. The queen herself had a
good friend in Dick Tarlton, for he told her,
says Fuller, "more of her faults than most
of her chaplains and cured her melancholy
better than all her physicians."</p>

<p>The inexorable almanac urged us on, but
one excursion that we could not forego was
that to Battlefield Church. Thither we drove
through such a tender afternoon, the soft sky
brooding close above the earth as if she loved
it, that it was hard to realise associations of
wrath and war. The sun made golden
windows in the clouds. The brown Severn
was slyly breaking down its banks as it ran.
We took our way through Shropshire lanes
whose hawthorn hedges on either side were
fringed with yellow wisps of rye scraped off
from the harvest loads. Beyond we came
upon the harvest fields with their shining
stacks. And in Battlefield Church itself we
found, almost rough-hewn from the tree-trunk,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
a mediæval image of Our Lady of
Pity.</p>

<p>Here was fought on another summer day,
July 21, 1403, the decisive battle between
Henry IV and the Percies. Henry had sat
but four years upon his troubled throne when
these proud nobles of the north, by whose aid
he had ousted Richard II, rose against him.
Although Richard had been murdered, Edmund
Mortimer, the next of blood, was a
thorn in Henry's pillow. Mortimer had been
taken prisoner by the revolting Welsh leader,
Owen Glendower, and Henry, if we may take
Shakespeare for our historian, listened coldly
and incredulously to Harry Percy's assurances
of Mortimer's resistance. In vain did
this eloquent Hotspur, Mortimer's brother-in-law,
pour forth his impetuous tale&mdash;how</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In single opposition, hand to hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He did confound the best part of an hour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In changing hardiment with great Glendower;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Three times they breath'd, and three times did they drink,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blood-stained with those valiant combatants."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span></div></div>

<p>When the king refused to ransom Mortimer,
Hotspur's anger bubbled over:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"He said he would not ransom Mortimer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forbade my tongue to speak of Mortimer,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But I will find him when he lies asleep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nothing but 'Mortimer' and give it him."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Thus Hotspur, and his father, the Earl of
Northumberland, his uncle, the Earl of Worcester,
"the irregular and wild Glendower,"
and the valiant Douglas of Scotland raised
their united banners against the usurper.
Many Cheshire gentlemen, to their sorrow,
joined Hotspur as he marched through their
county. He came in sight of Shrewsbury on
the evening of July nineteenth. But Henry was
there before him; the royal standard floated
over the castle; and it was three or four miles to
the north of the town that the shock of battle
came. Five thousand of the rebels and three
thousand of the loyal forces fell. The Earl
of Worcester was slain on the field, and "that
spirit Percy" himself, "the theme of honour's
tongue," he who had ever been "sweet fortune's
minion and her pride," perished there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
in the toils of his "ill-weav'd ambition."
The traditional spot where he fell is pointed
out, as also the antique oak from whose
leafy top Owen Glendower is fabled to have
watched, at a safe distance, the fortunes of the
fight.</p>

<p>Battlefield Church was built in gratitude
for this victory, and a perpetual chantry of
eight canons was endowed to serve it with
daily masses "for the king's salvation during
his life, and after his death for his soul, and
for the souls of his progenitors and of those
who were slain in the battle and were there
buried, and for the souls of all the faithful
departed." The meadow behind the church,
which, with its mounds, ridges, and depressions,
still bears the battle-scars, is supposed
to be the grave of thousands of the soldiers.
The masses were duly said for nearly one
hundred and fifty years, until the chantry was
surrendered to Henry VIII. The church,
abandoned after the Dissolution and suffered
to fall into decay, has been restored. Its
curious image of Our Lady of Pity was
an ancient treasure of Albright Hussey, a
neighbouring hamlet where we paused on
our homeward way to see a veritable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
moated grange, and was brought to Battlefield
early in the fifteenth century, when the
church was consecrated. In the vestry are two
small windows that keep such bits of the
original glass as could be gathered up from
the pile of shreds and splinters stored away
in a farm-building close by. One of the
recovered designs is a figure of Saint Elizabeth
of Hungary, vivid, ascetic, with loaf
in hand. But more vital yet is the portrait
of Henry IV&mdash;a royal form robed in such
glowing, living crimson as only the old craftsmen
knew how to pour into their glass.
The face, "wan with care," is earnest and
sorrowful.</p>

<p>Many are the battle-tales of these counties
on the Welsh marches. William the Conqueror
gave leave to certain of his followers
to take and hold what land they could in that
wild region, and a line of strong castles was
erected; but the fierce British, making sudden
raids from their mountain fastnesses, were a
constant threat and trouble, until Edward I,
despite the tuneful curses of all the Welsh
bards, reduced them to subjection, putting
the last native Prince of Wales to a cruel
death at Shrewsbury and transferring the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span>
title to his own firstborn son. As the jurisdiction
of the Marches became of importance,
special courts were held by the Prince of
Wales either in person or through a deputy
known as the Lord President of Wales,&mdash;an
office not abolished until 1688. The seat of
these courts was Ludlow, a place that even
to our partial eyes rivalled Shrewsbury in
beauty and is counted by many the banner
town of England. It stands in the very
south of Shropshire on a commanding height
just where the river Teme, which forms the
Hereford boundary, is joined by the Corve.
The lofty-towered Church of St. Lawrence,
only second in praise to St. Mary Redcliffe
of Bristol, and the impressive remains of
what was once both Castle and Princely
Palace crown this precipitous mass of
rock, from which broad streets, retaining
a goodly number of stately timbered
houses dating from the times when the
Courts of the Marches gathered illustrious
companies at Ludlow, descend to plain and
river. No description of this once royal
residence, with its pure, bracing atmosphere,
can better the honest lines of old
Tom Churchyard:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>The magnificent old castle has seen strange
sights. While undergoing siege by Stephen, in
his war against Maud, Prince Henry of Scotland,
who accompanied him, was caught up by
a long iron hook and all but pulled within
the walls. Stephen himself galloped up just
in time to cut the cords with his sword and
rescue the dangling prince. The redoubtable
Sir Hugh de Mortimer, Lord of Wigmore,
once lay captive in what is still known as
Mortimer's Tower. It cost him three thousand
marks of silver, besides all his plate,
horses, and hawks, to go free again. Ludlow
Castle was, at a later period, added by marriage
to the already formidable holdings of
the Mortimers. Roger de Mortimer took an
active part in the deposition of Edward II and
was created Earl of March. In imitation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
King Arthur, whose great tradition arches
over all that countryside, the ambitious young
noble held a Round Table, and conducted
Queen Isabella, with whom his relations were
not above suspicion, and his boy sovereign,
Edward III, to his castles of Wigmore and
Ludlow, where he entertained them with
"great costs in tilts and other pastimes."
There was not room in England for him and
for a king, and his arrogant career was ended
on the Smithfield gibbet. Marlowe gives him
a proud exit from the tragic stage:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i6">"Weep not for Mortimer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That scorns the world and, as a traveler,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Goes to discover countries yet unknown."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It was his great-grandson, Edmund de
Mortimer, who, by marriage with the daughter
of Prince Lionel, third son of Edward III,
gave that other Edmund Mortimer, his descendant,
a better title to the throne than that
of Henry IV. This last of the Mortimers was
until his death the apparently listless centre
of continual conspiracies. When he gave up
his ineffectual ghost, his estates passed to his
nephew, the vigorous Duke of York, who
fixed his chief residence at Ludlow Castle.
As the York rebellion gathered force and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span>
Wars of the Roses set in, this neighbourhood
became a centre of hostilities. The Lancastrians,
in their hour of triumph, wreaked
furious vengeance on Ludlow, but Edward
IV, on his accession, consoled the town with
a liberal charter and selected it as the residence
of his sons, the Little Princes of the
Tower. It is pleasant to think that before
their swift fate came upon them they had a
few years of happy childhood playing on the
greensward of those spacious courts, perched
up with their lesson books in the stone window-seats,
and praying their innocent prayers
within the arcaded walls of that circular Norman
chapel, built on the model of the Church
of the Holy Sepulchre and praised by Churchyard
as</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"So bravely wrought, so fayre and finely fram'd,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That to world's end the beauty may endure."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Another princely association, hardly less pathetic,
haunts these arched portals and embattled
towers. The heir of Henry VII, Prince
Arthur, in whom the greatness of Britain's
legendary hero was to live again, passed his
delicate childhood here, and here, shortly
after his marriage to Catherine of Arragon,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
died suddenly on a spring day of 1502, a lad
of sixteen summers. An unknown contemporary
tells how letters were hastily despatched
from Ludlow to His Majesty's
Council, and they, seeking the gentlest bearer
of such grievous news, "sent for the King's
ghostly father.... He in the morning of the
Tuesday following, somewhat before the time
accustomed, knocked at the King's chamber
door; and when the King understood it was
his Confessor, he commanded to let him in.
The Confessor then commanded all those
there present to avoid, and after due salutation
began to say, <i>Si bona de manu Dei suscepimus,
mala autem quare non sustineamus?</i>
and so showed his Grace that his dearest son
was departed to God. When his Grace understood
that sorrowful heavy tidings, he sent
for the Queen, saying that he and his Queen
would take the painful sorrows together.
After that she was come, and saw the King
her lord and that natural and painful sorrow,
as I have heard say, she with full great and
constant comfortable words besought his
Grace that he would, first after God, remember
the weal of his own noble person,
the comfort of his realm and of her ... over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span>
that how that God had left him yet a fair
prince, two fair princesses; and that God is
where he was.... Then the King thanked
her of her good comfort. After that she was
departed and come to her own chamber,
natural and motherly remembrance of that
great loss smote her so sorrowful to the heart,
that those that were about her were fain to
send for the King to comfort her."</p>

<p>We saw on a Sunday, in the beautiful
Church of St. Lawrence, a dole of bread for
the poor, a row of twelve goodly loaves set out
on a Tudor monument which is believed to
commemorate Prince Arthur, and possibly
to cover the ashes of his boyish heart, although
the body was buried in Worcester
Cathedral, where his chantry stands at the
right of the High Altar.</p>

<p>Among the tombs in the rich-windowed
choir is one whose inscription reads:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Heare lyethe the bodye of Ambrozia Sydney, iiii
doughter of the Right Honourable Syr Henry Sydney,
Knight of the moste noble order of the Garter, Lord
President of the Counsell of Wales, etc. And of Lady
Mary his wyef, doughter of the famous Duke of Northumberland,
who dyed in Ludlow Castell, ye 22nd of
Februarie, 1574."</p></blockquote><p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>We paused there a moment in reverence to
Sir Philip Sidney's mother, "a full fair lady"
who lost her beauty by nursing Queen Elizabeth,
from whom she took the contagion,
through an attack of smallpox, and afterwards
"chose rather to hide herself from the curious
eyes of a delicate time than come upon the
stage of the world with any manner of disparagement."</p>

<p>The last Lord Marcher before the Restoration
was the Earl of Bridgwater, whose appointment
was most gloriously celebrated by
the creation of Milton's "Comus," presented
on Michaelmas Night, 1634, in the Great
Hall of the castle. The first to hold the
office&mdash;thenceforth only nominal&mdash;after the
Restoration was the Earl of Carberry, whose
seneschal was one Samuel Butler, a steward
who may or may not have kept good accounts,
but who used his pen to effective purpose in
writing, in a chamber over the gate, the first
portion of "Hudibras."</p>

<p>Ludlow is the centre for fascinating excursions.
The delicious air and most lovely
scenery tempt one forth on roads that run
between bird-haunted banks fringed with
luxuriant bracken and lined with all manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
of trees to whose very tops climbs the aspiring
honeysuckle. The glint of red berries from
the mountain ash, the drooping sprays of the
larches, the silvery glimpses of far vistas
framed in leafy green, the spicy forest fragrances,
the freshness and buoyancy of the
air, all unite to make the spirit glad. From
every rise in the road are views that range
over a fair outspread of plain and valley,
rimmed by gentle hills. All over Worcestershire
we looked, and into Wales, and up
through Salop to where the Wrekin smiled
a gracious recognition. Points of special interest
abound,&mdash;Haye Wood, where Lady
Alice, daughter of the Earl of Bridgwater, and
her brothers lost their way and by their little
adventure gave young Milton the suggestion
for his Masque; St. Mary's Knoll, once
crowned by a venerated image of the Virgin;
Oakley Park, with its Druid trees; the little
church of Pipe Aston, with its curious semi-cirque
of Norman carving over the door;
Leinthall church, overtopped at either end
by lofty yews; British fort; Tudor mansion;
storied battlefield.</p>

<p>Our first goal was Richard's Castle in
Hereford, dating from the reign of Edward<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
the Confessor,&mdash;a Norman keep before the
Norman Conquest. Nothing of that brave
erection is left save a mound of earth and a
bit of broken wall. Near by stands an old
church with some remnants of fine glass and
with the rare feature, in England, of a detached
bell-tower. We lingered in the church
yard, looking out from a massive recumbent
slab that was cleft from end to end, as if the
impatient sleeper could not wait for the Archangel's
trump, eastward to the Malvern Hills,
whose earthly blue melted as softly into the
blue of the sky as life melts into death. But
a line of rooks flapping roostward awoke us
to the flight of time, and the pensive appeal
of that quiet spot, with its lichened crosses
and grave-mantling growths of grass and ivy,
was dispelled by a donkey who thrust his head
through a green casement in the hedge and
waggled his long ears at us with a quizzical
expression.</p>

<p>An excursion that could not be foregone,
however our consciences pricked us for delay,
was that to Wigmore, the once impregnable
hold of the Mortimers. As we left Ludlow,
we looked back on the looming grey mass of
its own still stupendous castle and were hardly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
prepared to find the rival fortress in such utter
desolation of decay. Standing on its sentry
height, girdled with its massive walls, it was
once a menace to the English throne. Now
such towers as yet remain are rent and ragged.
Only a curtain of ivy guards the inner gate.
Trees have sprung from the dirt-choked embrasures,
and purple thistles grow rank in the
empty courts. Yet for all the rich cloaking
of vine and wall-flower, all the carpeting of
moss and blossom, Time has not made peace
with this grim ruin. Something sullen and
defiant still breathes from those gigantic fragments.
Dark openings in the ground give
glimpses of stone passages and yawning dungeons
that must render the place a paradise
for boys. Thence we drove to Wigmore
Abbey where the Mortimers lodged the
priestly intercessors who had no light task
to pray away the sins of that proud and ruthless
race. We found a farm resounding with
the baaing of sheep and mooing of cows instead
of with Latin chants. Wrought into
the texture of the grange itself, a weather-stained
house of stone, with, as we saw it, a
row of decorative pigeons perched on the
roof-tree, are remnants of the old carvings<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
and window traceries. At the rear, a long,
low building of the Shropshire black-and-white,
with a great bundle of straw bulging
from an upper window, retains a fine arched
gateway. Pleached fruit trees, climbing roses,
and purple clematis do their best to console
the scene for its lost pieties. On the homeward
route, by way of yellow wheat fields,
waving woods, and running water, we had
a wonderful view of the Welsh mountains
bathed in the opalescent hues of sunset, a
divine lustre through which rang sweetly the
vespers of the thrush, and could hardly persuade
ourselves that it was from those glorified
heights the wave of war used to rush
down to break in blood upon the Marches.</p>

</div>

<p>Yet even the little round county of Herefordshire,
with its soft green levels, its apple
orchards and cider-presses, its hop gardens,
and those broad fields where graze its famous
sheep and cattle, has tragic tales to tell. Wigmore
Castle, indeed, is over the Hereford
line. A few miles to the northwest are the
ruins of Brampton-Bryan Castle, which testifies
to the latest war-anguish of these western
shires, the struggle to the death between
Charles I and Parliament. Here Lady Harley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
was besieged for over a month by her
royalist neighbour, Colonel Lingen, who&mdash;ill-done
for a cavalier&mdash;came up against her,
in the absence of her husband and son, with
a force of six hundred men. Cheery, gallant,
resourceful while the need lasted, Lady Harley
gave way when the baffled enemy had
withdrawn, and wrote her son that if the castle
must undergo another siege, she was sure that
God would spare her the seeing it. And having
so written, she died the following day. In
the spring the royalists returned with cannon
and battered down the walls, burning and
plundering. At the end of the long strife,
Parliament awarded Sir Robert Harley, as
some partial recompense for his sorrows and
losses, the Lingen lands, but Edward Harley,
the son of that brave, tender-hearted mother,
called at once on Lady Lingen and presented
her with the title-deeds. It may be doubted
if all the Herefordshire annals record a nobler
victory.</p>

<p>The Wars of the Roses were waged with
peculiar ferocity in this section of England.
The great battle of Mortimer's Cross, which
gave Edward IV his crown, was fought a little
to the west of Leominster. Here old Owen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
Tudor, who had wedded Henry V's French
Kate, daughter and widow of kings,&mdash;he
whose grandson, Henry VII, brought in the
Tudor line of English sovereigns, was taken
prisoner. He was executed, with all the
other prisoners of rank, in Hereford market-place,
and his head was "set upon the highest
grice of the market cross and a mad woman
kemped his hair and washed away the blood
from his face, and she got candles and set
about him burning, more than one hundred.
This Owen Tudor was father unto the Earl
of Pembroke, and had wedded Queen Katherine,
King Henry VI's mother, weening and
trusting always that he should not be beheaded
till he saw the axe and block, and
when he was in his doublet he trusted on
pardon and grace till the collar of his red
velvet doublet was ripped off. Then he said,
'That head shall lie on the stock that was
wont to lie on Queen Katherine's lap,' and
put his heart and mind wholly unto God, and
full meekly took his death."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a></p>

<p>Earlier civil conflicts, that between Edward
II and his barons, and that holier war
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>of liberty, won though lost, by Simon de
Montfort against his king and prince, have
left graphic memories in Herefordshire. But
even these strifes seem recent beside the
battle-marks of Offa the Saxon, who built an
earthen dyke, still in fairly good preservation,
from the Severn to the Wye, to keep the
Welshmen back; and beside those thick-set
British camps and Roman camps that testify
to the stubborn stand of Caractacus and his
Silures against the all-conquering legions.</p>

<p>We were on a peaceful pilgrimage and
could well dispense with visiting Coxwall
Knoll, close above Brampton-Bryan, where
Caractacus met his crushing defeat, and
Sutton Walla, some five miles to the north of
Hereford, where Offa, King of the Mercians,
betrayed to assassination his guest, King
Ethelbert of the East Angles; but we ought
to have sought out Holm Lacy, for the sake
of the Sir Scudamour of Spenser's "Faery
Queene," and to have visited Hope End,
near Ledbury, in loving homage to Elizabeth
Barrett Browning. And so we might, had
it not been for the innate depravity of man
as exemplified in the dourest driver that ever
handled reins. His one aim throughout that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
trip was not to go anywhere we wished. He
would sometimes seem to hesitate at a parting
of the ways, but it was only to find out which
road was our desire, when as deaf and dumb to
all our protests as if he knew only the Silurian
tongue, as impervious to parasol pokes as if
he were cased in Roman mail, he would take
the other. The only comfort that came to
our exasperated souls was the reflection that
at sundown we could dismiss Sir Stiffback
with his ill-earned shillings and never see his
iron phiz again, whereas the unfortunate
women of his household, the possible wife,
sister, daughter, would have to put up with
the unflinching obduracy of that cross-grained
disposition until he went the way of Roger de
Mortimer. But not even this cromlech of a
coachman, though with the worst intentions,
could prevent our enjoying the pastoral
charm of the quiet land through which we
drove, for this county, as Fuller wrote, "doth
share as deep as any in the alphabet of our
English commodities, though exceeding in
the W for wood, wheat, wool, and water." As
for wood, we saw in Harewood Park, by
which our Clod of Wayward Marl inadvertently
drove us, chestnuts and beeches whose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
height and girth would do credit to California;
in point of wheat the county is said to be so
fertile that, for all the wealth of cattle, the people
have not time to make their own butter
and cheese; the wool was reckoned in Fuller's
time the finest of all England; and the salmon-loved
Wye, which rises, like the Severn,
on the huge Plinlymmon mountain, flows
with many picturesque turns and "crankling
winds" across the county, receiving the Lug,
on which Leominster is situate, and further
down, the Monnow, which forms the Monmouth
boundary.</p>

<p>But if we failed to find the white-rose bower
of Mrs. Browning's childhood, and her classic</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"garden-ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the laurel on the mound,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the pear-tree oversweeping<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>&mdash;does the turf remember her Hector with
"brazen helm of daffodilies" and "a sword
of flashing lilies?"&mdash;we were on poetic territory
in the streets of Hereford. It was here,
as Mr. Dobell's happy discovery has shown,
that a lyrist, Thomas Traherne, worthy of
the fellowship of Herbert and of Vaughan<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span>
passed his early years, a shoemaker's son, like
Marlowe in another cathedral city, Canterbury.
If we could have seen Hereford as this
humble little lad saw it, it would have been
a celestial vision, for truly he said: "Certainly
Adam in Paradise had not more sweet
and curious apprehensions of the world than
I when I was a child." His own description
of this radiant star we so blindly inhabit as it
first dazzled his innocent senses is too exquisite
to be passed over:</p>

<blockquote><p>"The corn was orient and immortal wheat which
never should be reaped nor was ever sown. I thought
it had stood from everlasting to everlasting. The dust
and stones of the street were as precious as gold; the
gates were at first the end of the world. The green
trees when I saw them first through one of the gates
transported and ravished me; their sweetness and unusual
beauty made my heart to leap, and almost mad
with ecstacy, they were such strange and wonderful
things. The Men! O what venerable and reverend
creatures did the aged seem! Immortal Cherubim!
And young men, glittering and sparkling angels; and
maids, strange seraphic pieces of life and beauty! Boys
and girls tumbling in the street were moving jewels: I
knew not that they were born or should die. But all
things abided eternally as they were in their proper
places. Eternity was manifest in the Light of the Day,
and something infinite behind everything appeared,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
which talked with my expectation and moved my desire.
The City seemed to stand in Eden or to be built
in Heaven."</p></blockquote>

<p>If this were the Hereford of the first half
of the seventeenth century, the city has
dimmed a little since, yet we found it a pleasant
town enough, with the Wye murmuring
beside it, and its ancient cathedral of heroic
history reposing in its midst. Garrick was
born in Hereford, and poor Nell Gwynne,
and in the north transept of the cathedral is
a brass to John Philips, who endeared himself
to all the county by his poem on "Cyder."
We went to see the Preaching Cross that
marks the site of a monastery of the Black
Friars, neighboured now by the Red Cross
Hospital for old soldiers and servants. One
of these beneficiaries, in the prescribed "fustian
suit of ginger colour," eagerly showed us
about and was sorely grieved that we could
not wait to hear his rambling chronicle to the
end. The rest of our time in Hereford outside
our hostelry&mdash;the Green Dragon, most
amiable of monsters&mdash;we spent in the cathedral,
an old acquaintance, but so passing rich
in beauties and in curiosities that at the end
of our swift survey we were hardly more satisfied<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
than at the beginning. We will come
back to it some time&mdash;to the grave old
church that has grown with the centuries and,
unabashed, mingles the styles of various
periods, the church in which Stephen was
crowned and Ethelbert buried; to the croziered
bishops in their niches, the two great,
thirteenth-century bishops among them,
D'Aquablanca, the worst of saints with the
loveliest of tombs, and Cantilupe, so godly
that he never allowed his sister to kiss him,
of such healing virtues that even sick falcons
were cured at his shrine; to the Knights Templars,
mail-clad, treading down fell beasts;
to the wimpled dames with praying hands,
shadowed by angel-wings; to the Chapter
Library with its chained tomes; and to that
mediæval <i>Mappa Mundi</i> (about 1313) showing
the earth with its encircling ocean, Eden
and Paradise above, and such unwonted geographical
features sprinkled about as the
Phoenix, Lot's Wife, and the Burial Place of
Moses.</p>

<p>Our surly coachman deposited us at Ross,
the little border town with houses sloping
from the hilltop to the Wye, while behind and
above the mall rises a tall grey spire. Here<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
our faith in human nature was promptly
restored by that contemplation of the virtues of
The Man of Ross which even the public-house
signboards forced upon us. This John Kyrle
so lauded by Pope, was a cheery old bachelor
of modest income, the most of which he expended
for the town in works of practical
benevolence, planting elms, laying out walks,
placing fountains, and caring for the poor.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Whose cause-way parts the vale with shady rows?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose seats the weary traveler repose?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who taught that heaven-directed spire to rise?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'The Man of Ross,' each lisping babe replies."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the lisping babes are wrong as to this
last particular, for Kyrle did not build the
spire, although he gave the church its gallery
and pulpit.</p>

<p>At Ross we ought to have taken to the
water, for the scenery of the Lower Wye, with
its abrupt cliffs, rich woods, and smiling
meadows, is one of the prides of England, but
we had run so far behind our dates, by the
dear fault of Shropshire, that we went on by
train. The rail, however, follows the river,
and we had&mdash;or thought we had&mdash;swift
glimpses of the romantic ruins of Wilton<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
Castle, one of the old Border keeps, and of
Goodrich castle, where Wordsworth met the
little maid of "We are Seven." This valley
of the Wye, which was to the poet Gray the
delight of his eyes and "the very seat of
pleasure," yields striking effects in wooded
crag and gorge at Symond's Yat, but we enjoyed
hardly less the tranquil reaches of
green pasture, where the afternoon sunshine
still lay so warm that little groups of sheep
were cuddled at the foot of every tree. The
ancient town of Monmouth, in its nest of hills,
reminded us not merely of its royal native,
Henry V,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;"Ay, he was born at Monmouth,<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Captain Gower"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but of that twelfth-century romancer, Geoffrey
of Monmouth, whose "History of the
Britons," with its fluent account of the doings
of hitherto unheard-of kings, especially Arthur
the Giant Killer and his false queen Guanhumara,
so scandalised his contemporaries that
they did not scruple to call him a "shameless
and impudent liar" and to report that legions
of devils had been seen hovering over his manuscript.
About seven miles to the southwest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
of Monmouth is Raglan Castle, where Charles
I took refuge after Naseby. Its gallant lord,
the Marquis of Worcester, then in his eighty-fourth
year, stood a siege of ten weeks, not
capitulating until the loyal little garrison, fast
diminishing, was reduced to such extremities
that the horses ate their halters for want of
forage. I had visited, some fifteen years before,
those war-scarred towers, tapestried with
marvellous masses of ivy, and from the windows
of the Royal Apartments had looked
out on that lovely western view in which the
harassed Stuart took solace. Lord Herbert,
son of the staunch old royalist, invented and
constructed a machine, the terror of the peasantry,
which has a good claim to be counted
the first steam-engine. The so-called Yellow
Tower was the scene of his wizard craft. The
Great Hall now lies open to wind and weather,
and but one wall of the chapel stands, its two
stone effigies peeping out from their ivy-curtained
niches.</p>

<p>We quitted the train at Tintern, where our
stay was all too short, notwithstanding the
memory of tranquil weeks spent there in a
previous summer. The ruins of Tintern
Abbey are of a peculiarly austere and noble<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span>
beauty. Its foundation dates back to 1131,
only three years after the coming of the Cistercians
into England. It was the third of
their English houses, which came to number
nearly two hundred. It stood in its full grace,
the Gothic style just leaning toward the Decorated,
when the Dissolution struck its uses
from it and left it to gradual decay. Roofed
by the blue skies of a summer noon, with
wooded hills looking in through the unglazed
mullions of the windows, or in the glory of
the moonlight, the silver lustre flooding empty
nave and silent cloisters, and illuming with its
searching rays rare bits of carven foliage,
Tintern wears perhaps a purer loveliness in
its desolation than ever before. Our farewell
visit was paid in an early morning hour. In
that freshness of the day, those slender pillars
and arches delicately wrought presented an
aspect more than ever grave and melancholy.
There is nothing of the grotesque here, and
comparatively little of ornamental detail to
distract the mind from the impression of the
whole. The rooks that peered over from
their lofty perch above the great east window,
whose remaining traceries were etched in
shadow on the turf, and the bright-eyed little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
red-breasts that hopped fearlessly about did
not, it is true, observe the Cistercian rule of
silence; but the shining wings of doves fluttering
from one grey wall to another might well
have been the embodied prayers of those
White Monks who so often chanted matins
at the long-since fallen altars.</p>

<p>We went from the Abbey to the train. Still
the railroad followed the winding river. A
fleeting sight of the towering Wyndcliff reminded
me of a by-gone afternoon when, unexpectedly
bringing up on a ramble at Moss
Cottage, I undertook, quite too late for prudence,
a solitary ascent of this inviting steep.
From the summit I looked out over mellow-tinted
autumnal woods to the looping ribbon
of the Wye, the white cliffs known as the
Twelve Apostles rising beyond, and still beyond
the sail-bearing Severn, with villages
and church-towers discernible in the far distance
and, best of all, the rose of sunset glowing
upon the face of the Black Mountains.
It was a sublime vision, but when the western
flush had faded out and I must needs descend
by that ever-darkening path which took its
zigzag course among thick yews and down
slippery slabs of slate, I came to the conclusion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[276]</a></span>
it was not written that my neck should
be broken on this side of the Atlantic.</p>

<p>We had only an hour at Chepstow, but the
picturesque river-town was not new to us, and
the hour sufficed to revive our memories of
its rock-based old castle overhanging the Wye,
the castle where Jeremy Taylor was once imprisoned,
and its Norman church with deeply
recessed doorway. At Chepstow we took
train for Newport, crossing the strip of
garden-land that lies between the Wye, the
Gloucestershire boundary, and its almost
parallel stream, the Usk. West Monmouth
is Black Country, forming a part of the South
Wales coal-field, and we were not surprised
to find Newport a busy harbour, grimy with
its exports of coal and iron. We heard a
strange tongue spoken all about us and
realised that Monmouthshire, nominally English
since the time of Henry VIII, is still
largely Welsh in manners and in character.
The old Newport is much obscured by the
new. The castle, where Simon de Montfort
took refuge, is in good part hidden behind a
flourishing brewery, but the Church of St.
Woollos, built high upon Stow Hill, still dominates
the scene. This church has a history<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>
even older than its fine Norman architecture,
for it is told that Harold once plundered the
town, desecrating the original sanctuary and
breaking open the cheeses, which he found
filled with blood. Then he was aghast and
repented, but a month later, according to the
monastic record, "for that wickedness and
other crimes" he fell at Hastings.</p>

<p>Our goal was Caerleon, three miles up the
Usk, a quiet little village that was once the
capital of South Wales, once the Isca Silurum
of the Romans, and once, in the misty realm
of romance, that Caerleon-upon-Usk where
Arthur was crowned and where the ninth of
his twelve great battles was fought. Tennyson's
Lancelot relates to spellbound listeners
in the Castle of Astolat how</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i10">"at Caerleon had he helped his lord,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the strong neighings of the wild White Horse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Set every gilded parapet shuddering."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>But the "Mabinogion," that treasury of
fanciful old Welsh tales, gives, by way of contrast,
a naïve and somewhat gaudy picture
of the king enjoying his repose:</p>

<blockquote><p>"King Arthur was at Caerlleon upon Usk; and one
day he sat in his chamber; and with him were Owain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the son of Urien, and Kynon the son of Clydno, and
Kai the son of Kyner; and Gwenhwyar and her hand-maidens
at needlework by the window.... In the
center of the chamber, King Arthur sat upon a seat of
green rushes, over which was spread a covering of
flame-coloured satin; and a cushion of red satin
was under his elbow.... And the King went to
sleep."</p></blockquote>

<p>If the ghosts of the Second Augustan Legion
could return for an hour to this their frontier
station, deep in the British wilds, they would
find ranged and labelled in a neat museum
shards of their pottery, broken votive tablets,
fragments of sculptured figures, among them a
Medusa whose stony stare might seem to have
taken effect, urns whose ashes were long since
scattered, bits of mosaic pavement, coins,
lamps, needles, hairpins, waifs and strays of
their "unconsidered trifles." But the fainter
wraith of King Arthur would discover no
more than a weedy mound and hollow in a
ragged field, where autumnal dandelions keep
the only glints of his golden memory. We
met there an old labourer stooping beneath
the heavy sack upon his shoulder. He told
us that the mound was Arthur's Round Table,
but as for the hollow&mdash;apparently the site of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span>
a Roman open amphitheatre&mdash;he could only
shake his grey head and confide: "They do
say as was a grand palace there long ago and
one day it all sunk under,&mdash;sunk way down
into the ground."</p>

<p>The Usk, which has reflected such lost
splendours, empties into the broad estuary
of the Severn a little lower down than the Wye
which rejoins the greater river at Chepstow.
The Severn, which has its rising not two miles
from the Wye in the Welsh mountains, makes
a wider sweep to the east, crossing Shropshire,
Worcester, and Gloucester. Worcester, indeed,
mainly consists of the Middle Severn
valley, with ranges of low hills on either side.
This fertile basin abounds, like the Hereford
vale of the Wye, in apple-orchards and pear-orchards,
hop-gardens and wheat-fields, but
the enterprising little shire has developed, too,
a number of manufacturing industries. On
the north it runs up into the Black Country of
Staffordshire; Dudley, Stourbridge, and Oldbury
are murky with the smoke and smudge
of factory chimneys. Glass is a specialty of
Stourbridge, carpets of Kidderminster, salt
of Droitwich, and needles and fishhooks of
Redditch. Nail-making used to be the bread<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
and beer of ten thousand cottages at the foot
of the Clent and Lickey Hills.</p>

<p>But intermingled with its thriving crafts
and trades is another wealth of historic associations
and natural beauties. In the dense
woods which once covered the county, hostile
bands have dodged or sought one another
from time immemorial, notably during the
Civil Wars of Simon de Montfort and of the
Roses. Even so late as the Parliamentary
War, there remained forest enough to do
good service to a fugitive. It was in an oak
of Boscobel Wood, on the Salop border, that
after the disastrous battle of Worcester</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"the younger Charles abode<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Till all the paths were dim,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far below the Roundhead rode<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hummed a surly hymn."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The points of specific literary interest are
not many. Little St. Kenelm underwent his
martyrdom by the Clent Hills; Richard
Baxter ministered for twenty-two years to
a rough flock in Kidderminster; Samuel
Butler was born in Strensham-on-the-Avon;
Samuel Johnson went to school in Stourbridge;
and the Leasowes, near by, was the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
home of Shenstone, who made it one of
the most attractive estates in England. But
the Malvern Hills keep a great, dim memory,
that of the fourteenth-century visionary associated
with the West Midland allegory of
"Piers Plowman." We are not sure of his
name, though we speak of him as Langland;
the rugged, vigorous old poem in its three
versions may yet be proved to be of composite
rather than single authorship; we ourselves,
though of Long Will's discipleship,
had not faith enough in the personal tradition
to visit the reputed birthplace at Cleobury
Mortimer in Shropshire; but on those breezy
slopes still seems to linger the wistful presence
of a gaunt, "forwandred" clerk who</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"In a somer seson whan soft was the sonne,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On a May mornynge on Malverne hulles"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>dreamed the Easter dream, still unfulfilled on
earth, of human brotherhood.</p>

<p>These gracious heights, standing</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Close as brother leans to brother,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When they press beneath the eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of some father praying blessings<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>gave hiding for four years to Sir John Oldcastle,
the genial Lollard who made merry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span>
with Prince Hal, but would not renounce his
faith, and was finally given up by the over-orthodox
young king to the bishops. Henry V
himself was present at the martyrdom, peculiarly
revolting, but the worst of it all is that
Shakespeare, consciously or unconsciously,
endorsed the Roman Catholic caricature and
wronged a true and generous spirit in his ineffaceable
portrait of Sir John Falstaff, Prince
Hal's "old lad of the castle." It must be that
Raggedstone Hill, which casts a curse on
whomsoever its shadow touches, gloomed with
peculiar blackness over the hunted knight.
Its ominous shade is said to have stolen on
Cardinal Wolsey and on those royal fugitives
of the Red Rose, Margaret of Anjou and the
hapless young Prince Edward.</p>

</div>

<p>From the summit of Worcester Beacon and
from other of the higher Malvern crests the
view ranges, on a clear day, over some fifteen
counties and embraces the six momentous
battlefields of Shrewsbury, Mortimer's Cross,
Edge Hill, Worcester, Evesham and Tewkesbury,
and the three cathedrals of Hereford,
Worcester, and Gloucester, besides the remnants
of six great religious houses of mediæval
England,&mdash;Great and Little Malvern, Pershore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
Evesham, Deerhurst and Tewkesbury.
Little Malvern Priory, established in the
twelfth century by a band of Benedictine
monks from Worcester who sought the wilds
that they might emulate the life of hermits,
survives only in fragments, but the church of
Great Malvern Priory, an earlier outgrowth
from Worcester, keeps its Norman interior,
with rich treasures of stained glass and
miserere carvings. We had passed through
the Vale of Evesham toward the close of our
long Midland drive and seen the scant relics
of its mitred abbey, but we fail to follow the
Avon on to Pershore, one of the richest and
most powerful of the old monastic foundations.
Not only were these monasteries
planted in the fairest and most fruitful lands
of the county, but a large portion of Worcestershire
was owned by them and by the neighbouring
abbeys of Gloucestershire. In all
this horde of priests one has a special claim
to literary remembrance,&mdash;Layamon, who
dwelt in the hamlet of Ernley, near the
junction of the Severn and the Stour. He
constitutes an important link in the passing
on of the Arthurian legend, which, first related
in Latin prose by that entertaining<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
prelate, Geoffrey of Monmouth, had been
already rendered into French verse by Wace,
the professional chronicler of the Plantagenets.
Layamon retold and amplified the
story, using the French poem as his basis, but
aided by two other works whose identity is
doubtful.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Layamon these books beheld and the leaves he
turned. He them with love beheld. Aid him God
the Mighty! Quill he took with his fingers, and wrote
on book-skin, and the true words set together, and the
three books pressed into one."</p></blockquote>

<p>We could pay only a flying visit to Malvern
this summer, but in other summers have resorted
thither again and again for the refreshment
of the blithe air and pure water and of
walking on those turfy hills where many a
grateful sojourner has left path or seat to ease
the climber's way.</p>

<p>Worcester, too, was familiar ground, and
this time we gave but a few hours to the
"Faithful City," which paid so dearly for its
steadfast loyalty to Charles I. The unspeakable
Parliamentarians proved nearly as
destructive as the Danes, who, in the ninth
century and again in the eleventh, had sacked
it with fire and sword. The militant Presbyterians<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
wreaked their piety most of all upon
the Cathedral, leaving it roofless, its splendid
glass all shattered, its brasses wrenched away,
its altars desecrated and torn down. We
found the red-brick town upon the Severn
brisk and cheerful, with its proud shop-window
display of its own products, from
the Royal Worcester China to Worcestershire
Sauce, with the deeply laden barges that
almost hid the river; its lively hop market;
and its grunting sows, each with her litter of
recalcitrant little pigs, driven in a meandering
course through the main street by ruddy boys
and girls. The cathedral, whose memories
embrace St. Dunstan and St. Wulfstan and
that stout-hearted old martyr of Oxford,
Bishop Latimer&mdash;who had himself once presided
at the burning of a friar&mdash;uplifted
our hearts with its august vista of nave and
choir. The crowned tenant of that choir,
King John, ought to be troubled in his gilded
rest by the proximity of a Prince Arthur,
though not the Arthur to whom he did such
grievous wrong. The best of the cathedral
is, to my thinking, the solemn grace of the
crypt, beneath whose light-pillared arches
stand about various stone figures of rueful<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span>
countenance. After their centuries of sunlight,
high-niched on the central tower, the
Restorer has scornfully dislodged them and
dungeoned them down here.</p>

<p>Just below Worcester the Severn is augmented
by the Teme, which has valiantly cut
its way through the line of western hills to
join the court of Sabrina, and at Tewkesbury,
on the Gloucester border, it receives its
most famous affluent, Shakespeare's Avon.
Tewkesbury was new to us, and we lingered
there two days, wishing we might make them
twenty. As it was we had to forego the delightful
trip on the Severn to Deerhurst, an
old monastic town whose pre-Norman church
is said to be of extremely curious architecture.</p>

<p>Tewkesbury Abbey, which outranks in size
ten of the twenty-eight English cathedrals, is
one of the most illustrious churches in the
United Kingdom. Unlike most of the larger
monastic establishments, it was under the
control of a succession of great families whose
deeds and misdeeds form no small part of the
history of England. Fitz-Hamon, kin to the
Conqueror, swept away what buildings of
the old Saxon abbey he may have found there,
and erected the magnificent Norman church<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
which still awes the beholder. The ashes of
Fitz-Hamon, who died in 1107, rest near the
High Altar. The next lord of Tewkesbury to
be buried in the Abbey was Gilbert de Clare,
one of the signers of Magna Charta. The
name of his father, Richard de Clare, headed
the list, and one of the seven copies of the
Great Charter was deposited in the Abbey.
Every lord of Tewkesbury after Gilbert de
Clare was interred in this church, which, for
the next two hundred and fifty years, until
the lordship of Tewkesbury was absorbed
into the Crown, grew ever more splendid with
costly monuments. The widow of Gilbert
de Clare married the brother of Henry III,
Richard, Duke of Cornwall, but although she
thus became a countess of many titles and one
of the first ladies of the land, she asked, in
dying, to be buried beside the husband of her
youth in Tewkesbury. To this her second
husband would not agree, but he was magnanimous
enough to send her poor, homesick
heart back to the Abbey in a silver vase,
which was duly placed in Earl Gilbert's marble
mausoleum.</p>

<p>The De Clares of Tewkesbury, Earls of
Gloucester and Hereford, were a warrior race.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span>
The second Gilbert, called the Red Earl,
fought both with Simon de Montfort, and
against him, and the third Gilbert, his son,
fell at Bannockburn. By his early death the
lordship of Tewkesbury passed from the De
Clares, who had held it for nearly a century,
to the young earl's brother-in-law, Hugh le
Despencer. This new Earl of Gloucester
had succeeded Piers Gaveston in the perilous
favour of Edward II. When Roger de Mortimer,
by the unhallowed aid of Queen Isabel,
triumphed over the king, the elder Despencer,
a man of ninety, was hanged at Bristol, and
his son, Hugh le Despencer, crowned with
nettles, was swung from the gallows fifty feet
high, in a hubbub of mockeries and rejoicings,
at Hereford. His widow collected the scattered
quarters of his body, exposed in various
towns, and interred them in the Abbey under
a richly carved and coloured monument.
The Despencers, though no longer Earls of
Gloucester, held the lordship of Tewkesbury
for wellnigh another hundred years, cherishing
and beautifying the fabric of the church
and adding lavishly to its memorials of bronze
and marble and to its treasure of chalices,
copes, and jewels.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span></p>

<p>Early in the fifteenth century the male line
of the Despencers became extinct, and the
Lady Isabel, sister of the last Lord Despencer,
succeeded to the ecclesiastical honours of the
family. Married in the Abbey at the age of
eleven to Richard Beauchamp, Earl of Worcester,
she was widowed ten years later and
found her solace in building an exquisite
chapel, known as the Warwick Chantry, in
her husband's memory. Her second husband,
cousin to the first, was Richard Beauchamp,
Earl of Warwick, whom she commemorated
in the still more elaborate Beauchamp Chapel
at Warwick; but she herself chose to lie at
Tewkesbury. Her daughter married Warwick
the King-maker and became the mother
of two fair girls of most pathetic story. The
elder, Isabel, was wedded to George, Duke
of Clarence, brother of Edward III,&mdash;"false,
fleeting, perjur'd Clarence,"&mdash;who is supposed
to have been murdered in the Tower
through the agency of his brother Richard&mdash;drowned,
the whisper went, in a butt of Malmsey
wine. A fortnight earlier his wife and an
infant child had died, probably of poison. A
son and daughter survived, who, for the royal
blood that flowed in their veins, were regarded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
with uneasiness by the Tudor kings and ultimately
sent to the block. The daughter,
Margaret Plantagenet, superintended the education
of the Princess Mary, and was once
described by Henry VIII himself as "the most
saintly woman in England." But she was the
mother of Cardinal Pole, who had angered
the tyrant and was on the Continent out of
his reach; so this reverend and gracious lady,
at the age of sixty-eight, had her stately head
clumsily hacked off by a prentice executioner
on Tower Hill, where her innocent brother
had perished forty-two years before. The
second daughter of the Countess Isabel had
an even more pitiful life than her sister's, for
her first husband was Prince Edward, the last
Lancastrian, and then, after he had been
foully slain, she strangely accepted the hand
of one of his murderers, Richard of Gloucester,
the worst of the Yorkists, by whom she
was soon, it would appear, coolly put out
of the world. A favourite saying of the
county, probably having reference to the
extraordinary number and wealth of its
religious houses, runs: "As sure as God is
in Gloucestershire," but one can hardly read
these tragedies of Tewkesbury without feeling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span>
that the Devil has been no infrequent
sojourner there.</p>

<p>The lamentable Wars of the Roses, which
had drenched England with blood, threw up
their last red spray against the Abbey. The
resolute Queen Margaret and her son had
attempted, with an army raised by the Duke
of Somerset, to get possession of Gloucester,
but they found it already held by the Yorkists
and hastened on to Tewkesbury. Still weary
from their forced march, they were attacked
by Edward at break of a summer dawn (1471)
while the monks were chanting matins in the
Abbey, and sustained a signal defeat. The
place of slaughter is still known as Bloody
Meadow. The Duke of Somerset, with a
few knights and squires, took refuge within
the sacred walls, but Edward and his followers,
hot for vengeance, rushed in to slay
them even there. The abbot, who had just
been celebrating mass, came from the altar
and, holding the consecrated host high in his
hands, stood between the furious Yorkists
and their prey. The war-wrath was for the
moment stayed, and Edward gave his word
to respect the peace of the sanctuary. But
after a service of thanksgiving, the blood-anointed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
king and his fierce nobles withdrew
to a house hard by, where that unhappy
younger Edward, the legitimate heir to the
throne, was brought a defenceless prisoner
into their presence, insulted, assailed, and
slain. The rumour went that the king himself
had with his gauntleted hand struck the
royal youth across the mouth, and in an instant
the others, like wild beasts, were upon
him, Richard of Gloucester in the front. It
is believed that the mangled, boyish body was
buried in the Abbey under the central tower.</p>

<p>But while the lords of Tewkesbury stormed
through their brief careers, coming one after
another to lie, battle-bruised, stabbed, headless,
quartered, even with the halter-mark
about the neck, within the holy hush of the
great church, its Benedictine monks went on
a quiet way, tilling the soil, writing glosses,
copying service-books, chanting prayers, exercising
a large hospitality and a larger charity.
At the Dissolution, the townspeople, who had
from time immemorial used the nave as their
parochial church, bought the choir and chapels
from Henry VIII, so that this noble structure,
so significant in English story, escaped the fate
of Furness, Tintern, and the many more.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span></p>

<p>We had ourselves a little difficulty in getting
beyond the nave. We had gone in an hour
before service on a Sunday evening, hoping
to be allowed to walk around the choir, but
we incurred scathing rebuke from a red-haired
verger, who had practised like eloquence
on Sunday automobile parties until
his flow of denunciation was Hebraic. We
gave way at once, expressed due contrition,
and meekly sat down to wait for evensong.
Whereupon, after furtively scrutinising us
from behind one pillar after another, he cautiously
approached and with searching little
blue eyes severely inquired if we really intended
to stay for the service,&mdash;"all through
the sermon, ye understand; not just for the
music." Our reply so raised us in his opinion
that he actually took us on the rounds, proving
an intelligent and even jocose conductor,
and we, for our part, heard the sermon to the
very end, not daring to stir from our places
until the last note of "Milton's organ" had
died away.</p>

<p>Many visitors come to this attractive old
town, with its timbered houses and pleasant
river-walks, for the sake of "John Halifax,
Gentleman." The scenes of Mrs. Craik's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
tender romance, Abel Fletcher's dwelling, the
mill on the Avon, the tannery, the remains of
the famous hedge, the garden where the two
lads talked, are pointed out as soberly and
simply as that ancient house in Church Street
whose floor is said still to keep the stain of
princely blood, or the cross where the Duke
of Somerset and his companions, dragged
from the shelter of the Abbey in violation of
the king's own promise, were beheaded.</p>

<p>But the Severn, with ever-broadening flow,
a tidal river now that fills and shallows twice
a day, bears onward to the sea. Her course
lies for a while through orchards and wheat-fields.
The Cotswolds, separating the Severn
valley from the basin of the Thames and constituting
the bulk of Gloucestershire, rise in
billowy outlines on the east and, presently,
Dean Forest, one of the few remaining patches
of England's formerly abundant woods, uplifts
its "broad and burly top" on the west.
The earth beneath those oaks and beeches
has hoards of mineral wealth, and furnaces
are scattered through the forest glades. At
Gloucester the Severn divides, that</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i22">"with the more delight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She might behold the towne of which she's wondrous proud."<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span></div></div>

<p>And a fine old town it is, still keeping, in its
four right-angled streets, the original Roman
plan. Large vessels can make their way up
the Severn as far as Gloucester, which Elizabeth,
to Bristol's neighbourly disgust, chartered
as a seaport, though the Berkeley Canal,
opened in 1827, is now the regular channel.
The cathedral stands upon ground hallowed
since the seventh century. This building, for
all the solemn grandeur of its Norman nave,
is of most interest, from an architectural point
of view, because of its gradual development
of the Perpendicular style, gloriously manifest
in choir and cloister. Its masons seem
to have been particularly ingenious, for the
building abounds in original and fanciful
features of which the Whispering Gallery is
only an example. Its martyr is John Hooper,
Bishop of Gloucester and Worcester. One
of Mary's earliest victims, he was sent from
London back to Gloucester, where he was
greatly beloved, to be burned before the eyes
of his own flock. Many royal prayers have
been murmured beneath these vaulted roofs,
and many royal feasts of Severn salmon and
lamprey-pie held in the grey city. The
Saxon kings were much at Gloucester; William<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span>
the Conqueror spent his Yule-tides here
whenever he could, and here, in the chapter
house, he ordered the compilation of Domesday
Book; Rufus, Henry I, Henry II, and
John often visited the town, and Henry III,
as a boy of ten, was crowned in the cathedral.
Parliaments were held in Gloucester by Edward
I, Richard II, Henry IV, and Henry V,
and from Gloucester Richard III, with whom
murder had grown to be a habit, is supposed
to have sent secret orders to the Tower for the
smothering of his little nephews. In a side-chapel
is the tomb of Robert, Duke of Normandy,
eldest son of the conqueror. The
effigy, of Irish oak, is so instinct with force
and vigour in its only half recumbent posture
that the iron screen seems really necessary to
hold the Norman down. But the royal burial
that made the fortunes of the cathedral was
that of the wretched Edward II, whose canopied
tomb in the choir became a favourite
shrine of pilgrimage.</p>

<p>Still the Severn, now with a burden of
heavily freighted barges, a mighty flood that
has left more than one hundred miles behind
the tiny pool, three inches deep, in which it
rose, sweeps on, past the stern walls of Berkeley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
Castle, where Edward II was cruelly done
to death, toward the Somerset boundary.
Here it receives the waters of the lower Avon,
on which the great port of Bristol stands, and
so the proud Sabrina leads her retinue of
streams into the Bristol Channel,</p>

<h2><a name="SOMERSET_AND_DEVONSHIRE" id="SOMERSET_AND_DEVONSHIRE"></a>SOMERSET AND DEVONSHIRE</h2>


<p>The three southwestern counties of England,
Somerset, Devon, and Cornwall,
reach out, like the hearts of their
sons, into the wild Atlantic. Many a Westward
Ho adventure was sped from Bristol,
Bideford, Plymouth, Dartmouth, and even
from Topsham, which long served as the
port of Exeter. The far-sea Elizabethan
sailors and their dauntless commanders,
those "Admirals All" whose praises a living
poet of these parts, Henry Newbolt, has sung,
came largely from this corner of England.
The father of Sir Francis Drake was a
Tavistock tar. That dreamer of illimitable
dreams, Sir Walter Raleigh, was born in
the little Devon village of East Budleigh.
Another Devon village, familiar to Raleigh's
boyhood, Ottery St. Mary, is the native place
of Coleridge, whose immortal sea-ballad
came into being just over the Somerset
border, in those radiant days when he and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
Wordsworth, two young poets in the fulness
of their friendship and the freshness of their
inspiration, would go wandering together,
from their homes in Nether Stowey, off on
the Quantock Hills,&mdash;days commemorated
by Wordsworth in "The Prelude."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Upon smooth Quantock's airy ridge we roved,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unchecked we loitered 'mid her sylvan courts;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thou in bewitching words, with happy heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Didst chant the vision of that Ancient Man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The bright-eyed Mariner."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>My first view of the Quantocks was had,
some years ago, from Exmoor. Coming
through North Devon, we had been walking
for hours, knee-deep in heather, over that
high, rolling moorland where the red deer
still run wild. The pollen rose in clouds
about our heads. Black-faced sheep and
white-tailed rabbits and startled, flurrying
heath-cocks shared, but did not break, the
rapture of that solitude. Bell-heather and
rose-heather and white heather mingled their
hues, at a little distance, in a rippling sea of
purple. We lay down in it, and the fragrant
sprays closed warm about us, while the soft
sky seemed almost to touch our faces. We<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
were supremely happy and we hoped that we
were lost. We had long been out of sight of
human habitation, but our compass served
us better than we wished, and when, with a
covert sense of disappointment, though the
sun was red on the horizon, we came at last
upon a woman and child gathering whortleberries
in a dimple of the moor, we learned
that we were, as we should have been, in the
heart of the Lorna Doone country.</p>

<p>All lovers of Blackmore's delectable romance
remember that its modest hero, John
Ridd, of the parish of Oare, was a Somerset
man. "Zummerzett thou bee'st, Jan Ridd,
and Zummerzett thou shalt be." But the
Doone glen, which actually was, in the latter
part of the seventeenth century, the hold of a
marauding band of outlaws, lies on Badgeworthy
Water, a part of the Devon boundary.
We ate our handful of whortleberries in
Devon, but soon, following directions, found
ourselves on the brow of a steep incline,
peering over upon a farmhouse, known as
Lorna's Bower, in the valley below. Scrambling
down the declivity as best we might,
we crossed the Badgeworthy by means of a
log and a hand-rail, climbed a fence inhospitably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
placed at the end of this rude bridge,
and thus made unceremonious entrance into
Somerset. They were gruff of speech at
Lorna's Bower, but kind of heart, and treated
the belated wanderers well, feasting us on
the inevitable ham and eggs, with a last taste
of Devonshire cream, and giving us the warm
corner of the settle by the great, peat-burning
fireplace. A sheepskin waistcoat, with the
wool yet on, lay across the rheumatic knees
of our host, and hams and sides of bacon
dangled from the rafters overhead.</p>

<p>According to the saying "It always rains
on Exmoor," the next morning broke in
storm, and we made slow progress under the
rain and over the mud along the Badgeworthy.
All our path was a Waterslide, yet
we came at last to the Doone valley, where
tumbled heaps of stone mark the site of the
felons' houses. Foxglove and bracken and
heather would have whispered us the gossip
of the place, but a sudden spurt of especially
violent rain drove us on to a shepherd's hut
for refuge. Two sportsmen, booted and
spurred, with their horses saddled in the shed,
all ready to mount and ride if the Exmoor
hunt should sweep that way, were there before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span>
us. One of them told us that his own
house had the dints of the Doones' terrible
blows on one of its oak doors. As the
weather had gone from bad to worse, we
abandoned our walking trip, bestowed ourselves
in a creakity cart, the only vehicle
there obtainable, and drove past the little
Oare church, where John and Lorna were
so tragically wedded, over "Robbers'
Bridge," and on to the top of Oare Hill.
Here we paused for a memorable view of the
rain-silvered landscape, with Dunkery Beacon
glimmering above. On through blurred pictures
of beautiful scenery we went, into the
village of Porlock, sweet with roses, and
plunging down Porlock Hill, we held on our
gusty way to Minehead. The hostelries of
this favourite watering-place being full, we
pushed on by an evening train to Taunton, a
fair town of heroic history. In the stormy
times of Charles I, it was twice gallantly
defended by Admiral Blake, himself a son of
Somerset, against the cavalier forces. Forty
years later, when the unpopular James II
had succeeded to his brother's throne, Taunton
frankly embraced the perilous cause of
the Duke of Monmouth, welcoming him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
with joyous ceremonies. In Taunton market-place
he was proclaimed king, and from
Taunton he issued his royal proclamations.
The Duke was utterly defeated at Sedgemoor,
three miles to the east of Bridgewater,
in what Macaulay designates as "the last
fight deserving the name of a battle that has
been fought on English ground." The
simple Somerset folk who had followed the
banners of Monmouth were punished with
pitiless severity. The brutal officers made
a jest of the executions. A range of gibbets,
with their ghastly burdens, crossed the moor,
but Taunton was the especial victim of the
royal vengeance. A hundred prisoners were
put to death there by Kirke and his "lambs,"
and wellnigh another hundred hanged by
such process of law as was embodied in
Jeffrey's "Bloody Assize."</p>

<p>But we would not linger in Taunton,&mdash;no,
not even for the sake of its gentle Elizabethan
poet, Samuel Daniel, nor would we
stay our journey for trips to the places of
varied interest on either side. A little to the
southwest is Wellington, which gave The
Iron Duke his title. Going north from there
one would come soon to Milverton, the birthplace<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
of Dr. Thomas Young, that ingenious linguist
who first began to read the riddle of the
Sphinx; for he had deciphered some half
dozen of the Egyptian hieroglyphics in advance
of Champollion's great announcement.
A few miles further to the north is Combe
Flory, the pleasant parsonage which Sidney
Smith made so gay, even binding his books,
and theological books at that, in brightest
colours. To get a tropical effect, and to hoax
his guests, he hung oranges from his garden
shrubs, and to gratify a lady who hinted that
deer would ornament the little park, he fitted
out his two donkeys&mdash;who doubtless had
their opinion of him and of his doings&mdash;with
branching antlers, and stationed them before
the windows for a pastoral effect. Well
away to the east of Taunton is Ilchester, the
birthplace of that illustrious thirteenth-century
friar, Roger Bacon, a necromancer to his
own generation, and a pioneer in scientific
method to ours; and near by Ilchester is
Odcombe, where Tom Coryatt, stoutest-soled
of travellers, was born. He claimed
to have walked, between May and October
of 1608, no less than nineteen hundred and
seventy-five miles over the continent of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
Europe, and had just achieved a pilgrimage
to Jerusalem and a call on the Great Mogul
when, under the eastern stars, he died.
England profited by his travels in the entertaining
volume commonly known as Coryatt's
"Crudities," as well as in that foreign elegance
of table-forks which he is said to have
introduced.</p>

<p>A mightier spell than any of these was
upon us, the spell of Glastonbury, but I do
not know why we did not give a few hours
to Athelney, which lay directly in our route.
It was here, on an alder-forested island in a
waste of fens and marshes, at the confluence
of the Parrett and the Tone, that King Alfred
took shelter when the Danes had overrun the
land. Here he lost that "Alfred's Jewel"
which is now the treasure of the Ashmolean
Museum in Oxford; here this otherwise
impeccable monarch burned the cakes; and
from here he made such successful sallies
against the enemy that he delivered England
and regained his throne.</p>

<p>The county of Somerset, a land of broad,
green valleys enclosed by rugged ranges of
hill and upland, has been compared in form
to an arm slightly bent about the eastern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
and southern shores of Bristol Channel.
The river Parrett crosses it at the elbow,
dividing it into a southern section,&mdash;moors,
bogs, mountains, with the deep vale of the
river Tone&mdash;and a northern part, larger
and more populous, but hardly less broken.
Above the Parrett, and almost parallel with
it, runs the river Brue, draining that once
vast peat swamp known as the Brent Marshes.
Glastonbury now stands on the north bank
of the Brue, but at some remote period was
islanded in the midst of the river. The
Britons&mdash;if the wise say true&mdash;called it
The Appletree Isle, or Avalon,&mdash;a name
caught up in the golden meshes of Arthurian
romance. The wounded king but</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i8">"passes to the Isle Avilion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He passes and is heal'd and cannot die."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Britons in their heathen days had
dreamed of a fairyland where death and
sorrow entered not, the Celtic Tir-na-n'Og,
an Island of Immortal Youth hid somewhere
in the flushed, mysterious west, and the
Christian faith, that came so early to Glastonbury,
did not destroy but gathered to itself
the wistful hope, so that the site of one of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
earliest churches in England became the
centre of strangely blended legends. It was
in the Isle of Avalon, according to Geoffrey
of Monmouth, that the sword Excalibur was
forged, and after Arthur had passed from
mortal ken, he was not dead, but still, through
the waiting centuries,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Mythic Uther's deeply wounded son<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In some fair space of sloping greens<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay, dozing, in the vale of Avalon,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And watched by weeping queens."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Yet the mediæval voices, that we would
gladly believe more simply than we may,
tell us that Arthur was buried at Glastonbury
in a sarcophagus hollowed out of the
trunk of an oak, that the penitent Guinevere
was laid at his feet, that the skeletons were
uncovered and removed to the church in the
reign of Henry II, and were seen by so sane a
witness as Leland so late as the middle of
the sixteenth century. But in King Arthur,
death is life, and not his reputed grave, nor
the giant bones folk wondered at, nor the
golden lock of Guinevere that crumbled at a
monk's too eager clutch, could shake the
faith in his second coming. Malory, writing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
in the fifteenth century, illustrates even in his
half denial the persistency of that expectation:</p>

<blockquote><p>"Yet some men say in many parts of England that
King Arthur is not dead, but had by the will of our
Lord Jesu into another place, and men say that he
shall come again, and he shall win the holy cross. I
will not say it shall be so, but rather, I will say,&mdash;here
in this world he changed his life, but many men
say that there is written upon his tomb this verse:
<i>Hic jacet Arthurus Rex quondam Rexque futurus</i>."</p></blockquote>

<p>Arthurian legends are attached to other
places in Somersetshire, notably to Cadbury,
whose earlier name was Camelot, and to its
adjacent village of Queen's Camel. Here
on the river Camel cluster Arthurian names,&mdash;King
Arthur's Palace, a moated mound;
King Arthur's Well, a spring of magic virtues;
King Arthur's Hunting Causeway, an
old track across the fields; and here the tradition
of a great battle lingers. But Glastonbury
is not only an Arthurian shrine; it
was once, in purer days than ours, the keeper
of the Holy Grail.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"To whom the monk: 'The Holy Grail! ...<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Dreamy hours were those we spent under
the shadow of Glastonbury Tor, among the
tranquil ruins of that once so glorious abbey,
strolling about with a motley company of
sheep, chickens, and tourists over what is
perhaps the most ancient consecrated ground
in England. Hither came St. Joseph of
Arimathæa with his eleven companions and
here the staff of the saint, as he thrust it into
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>the ground, put forth leaf and blossom as a
signal that the resting-place was reached.
The little wattled oratory that the Archangel
Gabriel commanded and the pagan king permitted
them to build on a waste island of the
marsh was succeeded, in course of time, by
a primitive form of monastery, where St.
Patrick, his mission to Ireland accomplished,
dwelt many years and died. Here in a later
century great St. Dunstan held the post of
abbot and waged at his forge stern warfare
against the Devil. And it is sober history
that here a Christian church and brotherhood
lived on in unbroken peace from British
times to English. "What Glastonbury has
to itself, alone and without rival," says Freeman,
"is its historical position as the tie, at
once national and religious, which binds the
history and memories of our race to those of
the race which we supplanted."</p>

<p>The after-story of Glastonbury is as tragic
as that of Whalley. A mitred abbey, enlarged
and enriched from generation to generation,
it became a court whither the sons
of noblemen and gentlemen were sent for
nurture in gracious manners; a school of
learning whose library was one of the most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
precious in the realm; a seat of princely
hospitalities and lavish charities. When the
storm burst, Abbot Whiting strove to hide
from the spoilers some of the abbey plate.
He was forthwith arrested at his manor of
Sharpham&mdash;the very house where Fielding
the novelist was afterwards born,&mdash;sentenced
at Wells, dragged on a hurdle to the
top of Glastonbury Tor, and there hanged
and butchered, his head being spiked above
the abbey gate. The magnificent church
and extensive conventual buildings, stripped
and abandoned, long served the neighbourhood
as a quarry. Richly sculptured blocks
were built into barns and garden-walls and
even broken up for making a road over the
marshes. Little is left for the gazer now
save a few weed-crowned columns, an exquisite
Early English chapel on the site of
St. Joseph's wattled church, a gabled tithe-barn,
an old pilgrim inn, and the Abbot's
Kitchen, a witchcap structure whose four
vast fireplaces must all have roared with
jollity when Abbot Whiting chanced to be
entertaining five hundred "persons of
fashion" at a single dinner-party. As we
wandered over the daisied pastureland from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
one grey fragment to another, we realised the
invisible Glastonbury all the more in the
peace that has come with the perishing of
the visible. "Time the Shadow" has but
softened the splendour. More than ever is
this</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">"the island-valley of Avilion;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard lawns<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And bowery hollows."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is only six miles from Glastonbury to
Wells, one of the loveliest cathedral cities of
England, not a place to hurry through, but
to settle in and quietly enjoy. Lodgings in
Vicar's Close, leisurely strolls through the
gardens of the Bishop's Palace, hours of
revery in choir and chapter-house and Lady
Chapel,&mdash;it is so that one is taken to the
heart of all this holy beauty. The foundation
dates back to the beginning of the eighth
century, but Saxon church melted into Norman,
and Norman into Early English,&mdash;substantially
the cathedral of to-day, with
that wonderful façade of which Fuller truly
said: "England affordeth not the like." The
story of the city is the story of the church, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
the story of the church is one of honour and
untroubled peace. Not being a monastery,
it was untouched by the blow that smote
Glastonbury down. The rage of war has
passed it by. Its bishops have left saintly
memories. Above this matchless group of
ecclesiastical buildings tender benignities
brood like outspread wings. There is blessing
in the very air.</p>

<p>Wells lies in a basin at the foot of the Mendip
Hills, which offer tempting points for
excursions. Our most uncanny trip was to
Wookey Hole, where, according to a ballad in
Percy's "Reliques," "a blear-eyed hag" used
to dwell. A farmer, groaning with rheumatism,
guided us along a rocky footpath
to the cavern entrance, where an impish boy
met us, gave us lighted tapers and himself
literally blazed the way with a can of some
lurid-burning oil. After scrambling up and
scrambling down, frequently abjured by our
little leader to "mind yer 'eads," we left
Hell's Ladder behind us and came out into
an open space known as the Witch's Kitchen.
Here was the Witch herself, a sphinx-like
figure made by the petrifaction of the water
dripping from the roof. She received us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
with a stolid stare, the graceless urchin threw
a pebble at her flat nose, and we gladly
scrambled back to upper day.</p>

<p>I have a pleasanter recollection of Cox's
Cave at Cheddar, with its clearly defined
pillars and pinnacles, some amber, some
olive, some transparent, some musical. It
requires but little imagination to distinguish
in this fantastic world the queer assortment
of "Hindoo Temple," "Mummy," "Bat's
Wings," "Eagle's Wings," "Loaf of Bread,"
"Hanging Goose," "Rat running up a
Rock," "Turkeys," "Carrots," and the
splendid "Draperies." There is a place
where stalagmite and stalactite nearly touch,&mdash;only
one drop wanting, yet in all these
years since Mr. Cox, while prosaically digging
for a coach-house, discovered this elfin
grotto, in 1837, that drop has not crystallised,&mdash;so
slow is the underground sculptor.</p>

<p>All this region of the Mendip Hills, whose
limestone cliffs rise sheer, terrace above
terrace, is full of fascination. Traces of
prehistoric man, as well as of extinct animal
species, have been found in its deep caverns.
In the Hyæna Den, when disclosed in 1852,
the eyes of geologists could discern the very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
places where our shaggy forbears had lighted
their fires and cooked their food. It seems
a far cry from those low-browed cave-folk to
Lord Macaulay, who loved this West Country
so well, and to John Locke, who was born
in the village of Wrington,&mdash;a village which
furthermore prides itself on one of the noblest
church-towers in Somerset and on the decorous
grave of Hannah More.</p>

<p>All manner of literary associations jostle
one another in the town of Bath, to which
at home I have heard English visitors liken
our Boston. They meant it as a compliment,
for Bath is a handsome city, even ranked
by Landor, one of its most loyal residents,
above the cities of Italy for purity and consistent
dignity of architecture. To reach
Bath we have journeyed east from the Mendip
Hills into the valley of the Lesser Avon.
Here "the Queen of all the Spas" holds her
court, the tiers of pale stone terraces and
crescents climbing up the steep sides of the
valley to a height of some eight hundred feet.</p>

<p>Of the sights of Bath, the Abbey is most
disappointing, and well it may be, for it was
despoiled not only of its glass but even of its
iron and lead by Henry VIII, and only a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
bleak framework left to pass through a series
of purchasers to the citizens. The west
front wears a curious design of ladders on
which battered angels clamber up and down.
The interior has no "dim religious light,"
but gilt and colour and such a throng of
gaudy monuments that the wits have made
merry at the expense of the vaunted mineral
springs.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"These walls, adorned with monument and bust,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Show how Bath waters serve to lay the dust."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The healing quality of the waters is attributed,
by the veracious Geoffrey of Monmouth,
to the British king Bladud, father of
King Lear. This Bladud, being skilled in
sorcery, placed in the gushing spring a cunning
stone that made the water hot and
curative. The wizard met an untimely end
in a flight on wings of his own devising. He
rode the air safely from Bath to London,
but there fell and was dashed in pieces on the
roof of the temple of Apollo. The Romans
knew the virtue of these waters, and modern
excavation has disclosed, with other remnants
of a perished splendour, elaborate
Roman baths, arched and columned and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span>
beautifully paved. It is so long since the
hour when I went wandering down into
those buried chambers that I but dimly
recall a large central basin, where languid
gold-fish circled in a green pool, begirt by a
stone platform, old and mossy. This was
set about with pilasters and capitals and all
manner of classic fragments, among which
were mingled bits of mediæval carving.
For a Saxon monastery was founded here,
where, according to the Exeter Book, still
stood "courts of stone," and the baths were
known and frequented throughout the Middle
Ages and in Tudor and Stuart times.
But the Bath of the eighteenth-century society-novel,
the Bath of which Miss Burney
and Miss Austen, Fielding and Smollet have
drawn such graphic pictures, owed its being
chiefly to Beau Nash. The city to which
this gallant Oxonian came in 1703 was a
mean, rough place enough. The baths were
"unseemly ponds," open to the weather and
to the view of the passersby, who found it
amusing to pelt the invalid bathers with
dead cats&mdash;poor pussies!&mdash;and frogs. But
Nash secured a band of music for the Pump
Room, set orderly balls on foot, and soon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
won the title of King of Bath, which he made
such a focus of fashion that the place grew
during his lifetime from its poor estate into
the comely city of to-day. This arbiter of
elegance maintained a mimicry of royal
pomp. His dress glistened with lace and
embroidery and he travelled in a chaise
drawn by six grey horses, with a full complement
of outriders, footmen, and French
horns.</p>

<p>The Pump Room is worth a visit. It is
an oblong saloon, with a semicircular recess
at either end. At the west end is a music
gallery, and at the east a statue of Beau Nash.
A three-fourths square of cushioned seats
occupies the middle of the room and opens
toward a counter. Here a white-capped
maid dispenses, at twopence a glass, the
yellow fluid which hisses up hot from a
fountain just behind her and falls murmuring
into a marble vase. And all about, a
part of the spectacle, sit the health-seekers,
sipping the magic water from glasses in decorated
saucers and looking a trifle foolish.</p>

<p>Here, or in steering one's course among
the Bath chairs that claim a native's right of
way in park and promenade, fancy may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span>
choose almost any companion she will.
Pope hated Bath, to be sure, and called it
"the sulphurous pit," but not even Pope
kept out of it; Beckford, the author of
"Vathek," lived here; Butler, author of the
"Analogy," died here; Pepys scribbled a page
of his "Diary" here; Herschel the astronomer
played a chapel-organ here; Lord Chesterfield's
manners and Sheridan's wit found
here an apt field of exercise; but for my
part&mdash;and it was a scandalous choice, with
the ghosts of Pitt and Burke, Wolfe and
Nelson, Cowper and Scott and Goldsmith
and Moore ready to do escort duty&mdash;I
wished for the company of Chaucer's Wife
of Bath, for such a piquant gossip could not
have failed to add some entertaining items
to the story of the town.</p>

<p>Our final pilgrimage of last summer was
made to Clevedon, a lonely village which
has within half a century become a popular
summer resort. It lies</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"By that broad water of the west,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>where the Severn merges into the Bristol Channel.
Here is Myrtle Cottage, where Coleridge
and his bride had their brief season of joy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Low was our pretty cot; our tallest rose<br /></span>

</div>

<p>But our first walk took us by the beach and
across the fields to that "obscure and solitary
church" where lies Tennyson's Arthur,
son of Henry Hallam the historian, and himself
a poet. He was in Vienna when</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"God's finger touch'd him and he slept,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and Tennyson linked the Austrian and the
English rivers in his elegy.</p>

</div></div>

<p>The ancient church, now but seldom
opened for service, was locked, and we had
to hunt for the sexton. It was dusk when
he arrived, but we groped our way to the
south transept and, by the light of a lifted
taper, made out the pathetic farewell:</p>

<p class="center">

<p>It was this tablet that haunted the restlessness

fell across his bed slipping into the transept
window and becoming "a glory on the
walls."</p>

</div></div>

<p>From Clevedon, from Bath, from Cheddar,
from Wells, the roads lead to Bristol,
which must not, if only for the sake of poor
Chatterton, be ignored. This worn, dignified
old city has had something of a vagrant
career. Before the Norman Conquest,
and for long after, Bristol stood north of the
Avon and was a Gloucestershire town. In
course of time it stretched across the river
and lay partly in Somerset. And in the
fourteenth century, when for wealth and
consequence it ranked second only to London,
Edward III created it a county by itself.
From the dawn of its history it was a
trading-mart. Nothing came amiss to it,
even kidnapping, so that among its gains it
gained the title "Stepmother of all England."
The merchants and the mariners of Bristol
stood in the front of English enterprise.
Even in the time of Stephen it was deemed
wellnigh the richest city of the kingdom.
When a foreign war was in hand, Bristol
could be counted on for a large contingent<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
of ships and men. Its merchants lived in
towered mansions, with capacious cellars
for the storage of their goods, warehouses
and shops on the street floor, the family
parlours and bedrooms above, and attics for
the prentices in the sharp-pitched gables.
The banquet-halls, at the rear of these spacious
dwellings, were splendid with carven
roofs, rich tapestries, and plate that would
have graced a royal board. Even the critical
Pepys, who visited Bristol after its Spanish
and West Indian trades were well established,
found its quay "a most large and noble
place."</p>

<p>Bristol sailors bear no small part in the
tales of English sea-daring and records of
discovery. As early as 1480, Bristol merchants
were sending out tall ships to search
west of Ireland for "the Island of Brazil
and the Seven Cities." Sixteen years later
the Venetian mariner, John Cabot, probably
accompanied by his son Sebastian&mdash;"shadow-seekers,"
the old Bristol tars would
call them&mdash;had touched the coast of North
America. On his return the "Great Admiral"
clad himself in silk and was a notable
figure in the Bristol streets. Phantasmal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
though it all seems in a retrospect of centuries,
many are the men who have drawn the
gaze in these ever-moving thoroughfares,&mdash;William
Canynges, "Merchant Royal,"
whose trade with the north of Europe probably
exceeded that of any other merchant in
England; Thomas Norton, fifteenth-century
alchemist and dreamer, who believed
that he had discovered both the Philosopher's
Stone and the Elixir of Life; Captain
Thomas James, for whom James's Bay is
named, he whose search for the Northwest
Passage is one of the heroic chapters in the
annals of the sea; the Reverend Richard
Hakluyt, always deep in talk with some
grizzled seaman; Captain Martin Pring,
proud of the load of sassafras he had brought
back from Cape Cod; Colston the philanthropist,
the local saint. Mere literary folk
would have been embarrassed by little enough
attention as they went their quiet ways.
What was Chatterton to the trading, shipbuilding,
ship-lading town but a bright-eyed
Blue-Coat boy? And how those hard-headed
merchants would have chuckled over the
eager scheme of three penniless young poets,
Coleridge, Southey, and Lovell, for founding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
a community on the Susquehanna&mdash;a river
of melodious name and delightfully far away&mdash;where
no one should labour more than
two hours out of the twenty-four!</p>

<p>I have been in Bristol several times, but I
remember the workaday old city as I saw it
first. It was September weather, and College
Green was strewn with sallow leaves
that flitted and whispered continually like
memories of the past. A few fat sheep were
in possession, together with a statue of Queen
Victoria and a Gothic cross. On the south
of the Green, once the burial-ground of the
abbey, stands the cathedral, the older portion,
in contrast with the new, looking black
and rough and massy. The jewel of this
building&mdash;which was one of the few abbey
churches to profit by the Dissolution, in that
Henry VIII was graciously pleased, establishing
the bishopric of Bristol, to raise it to
cathedral rank&mdash;is its Norman chapter-house,
a rectangular chamber wonderfully enriched
with stone carvings and diaper work
and interlaced arcades. Among the bishops
on whom the silvery lights from the Jesse
window, the great east window of the choir,
have fallen, are Fletcher, father of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span>
dramatist, and Trelawney of Cornish fame.
With a lingering look at the Norman archway
known as College gate, whose elaborate
mouldings are worn on the sea-wind side,
but still distinct on the other, I crossed the
Green to the Mayor's Chapel, a little Gothic
church of peculiar beauty, with windows that
are harmonies in glass, and with monuments,
among which the burgess element is marked, so
old and strange, yet so naïve and natural, that
the valour, love, and grief of a far past seem
but held in slumber there. If the marble
figures rise and talk together on All Saints'
Eve, it is a quaint but seemly assemblage.</p>

<p>Bristol, even in the palmy days of her
rum-trade and her slave-trade, was always
singularly given to religion, and her churches
are numerous,&mdash;St. Peter's, her mother-church,
with an Early Norman tower, guarding
the ashes of her hapless poet, Richard
Savage, who died, a debtor, in Newgate
prison hard by and was buried at his jailer's
costs; St. Stephen's, whose turreted Perpendicular
tower is one of the sights of the city;
and many another; but supreme among
them all,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The pride of Bristowe and the Western londe,"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></div></div>

<p>is St. Mary Radcliffe. This superb structure,
ever since the day when Queen Bess
called it "the fairest, the goodliest, and most
famous parish-church in England," has gone
on adding praise to praise. It is of ancient
foundation, still observing, at Whitsuntide,
the ceremony of rush-bearing, but it was
rebuilt, in course of the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries, by Mayor Canynges the
grandfather and Mayor Canynges the grandson.
It is a pity that their alabaster heads
should be all scratched over with initials.
It was in this church that Chatterton pretended
to discover the manuscript poems of
his invented monk Rowley; it was here that
Coleridge and Southey wedded the ladies of
their Pantisocratical choice; and every good
American is expected to thrill at the sight of
the armour, hanging from one of the piers, of
the gallant admiral, Sir William Penn, a native
of Bristol and the father of our Quaker.</p>

<p>On my first visit, I righteously went on
bustop out to Clifton, the breathing-place
of Bristol, viewed the great grassy upland,
with the Avon flowing muddily through a
deep gorge, paced the boasted Suspension
Bridge that spans the gorge, and finally, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span>
way of tribute to "Evelina" and "Humphrey
Clinker," followed "the zigzag" down to the
Hotwells, whose glory as a spa is now departed.
But of all that one may see in or
about Bristol, nothing so impresses the mind
as the big, plain, serious old town itself. It
has been out-distanced in commerce and in
manufacture by those giant upstarts, Liverpool
and Manchester, yet it is still patiently
pushing on in its accustomed track. So absorbed
in business routine does it seem that
one almost forgets that it has ever had other
than practical interests,&mdash;that the "Lyrical
Ballads" found their publisher here,&mdash;but
gives one's self over to the latent romance of
commerce and of trade. One wanders
through Corn Street and Wine Street and
Christmas Street, by Bakers' Hall and
Spicers' Hall and Merchant Venturers' Hall,
and&mdash;for the tidal Avon is navigable even
for vessels of large tonnage&mdash;is ever freshly
astonished, as Pope was astonished, to behold
"in the middle of the street, as far as you
can see, hundreds of ships, their masts as
thick as they can stand by one another, which
is the oddest and most surprising sight
imaginable."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span></p>

<p>The last great city in our summer path was
Exeter, whose greatness is of the past. Exeter
is, like Bristol, a county of itself, and yet
stands, in a true sense, as the capital of
Devonshire. It is, moreover, the heart of
the whole West Country. "In Exeter," says
Mr. Norway, a Cornishman, "all the history
of the West is bound up&mdash;its love of liberty,
its independence, its passionate resistance to
foreign conquerors, its devotion to lost causes,
its loyalty to the throne, its pride, its trade,
its maritime adventure,&mdash;all these many
strands are twined together in that bond
which links West Countrymen to Exeter.
There is no incident in their past history
which does not touch her. Like them she was
unstained by heathendom, and kept her faith
when the dwellers in less happy cities further
north were pricked to the worship of Thor
and Odin at the point of Saxon spears. Like
them she fought valiantly against the Norman
Conqueror, and when she fell their cause
fell with her. And since those days what a
host of great and stirring incidents have happened
here, from Perkin Warbeck beating
on the gates with his rabble of brave Cornishmen,
to William of Orange going in high<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
state to the cathedral, welcomed already as
a deliverer to that throne which it lay almost
with Exeter to give or to withhold."</p>

<p>Exeter impresses the stranger to-day merely
as a prosperous county-town, a pleasant
cathedral city, yet in the reign of Stephen it
was ranked for importance next after London,
York, and Winchester, supplanting Lincoln,
once the holder of the fourth place,
from which it was soon itself to be dislodged
by Bristol. But Exeter, seated on the hill
where, in dim, wild ages a band of Britons
built them a rude stronghold, beside the
stream up whose reddened waters the vessels
of Roman and Saxon and Dane have fought
their way, does not forget. So faithful is her
memory, indeed, that still the vicar of Pinhoe,
a village almost in her suburbs, receives every
year a handful of shining silver pieces in
recognition of a deed of daring performed by
a long-ago predecessor in his holy office.
When the West Countrymen, bent on driving
out the Danes, were in the thick of a hard
fight there at Pinhoe, their supply of arrows
fell short, and this plucky priest, girding up
his gown, dodged through the enemy to the
citadel, bringing back&mdash;so schoolboyish were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span>
those old battles&mdash;a bundle of feathered
shafts that might have saved the day. But
although the Danes triumphed, Exeter has
paid an annual reward of sixteen shillings
to the vicar of Pinhoe ever since&mdash;a period
of some nine hundred years.</p>

<p>We rendered, of course, our first homage
to the cathedral, rejoicing in the oft-praised
symmetries of the interior and, hardly less,
in the tender colour-tones that melted, blues
into greys, and fawns into creams, with the
softening of the light. The cathedral library
contains that treasure of our literature, the
Exeter Book, an anthology of Anglo-Saxon
poetry, "one great English book of divers
things, song-wise wrought," left by the will
of Bishop Leofric, who died in 1072, to "Saint
Peter's minster in Exeter where his bishop-stool
is." Miles Coverdale, translator of the
Bible, was bishop here in Tudor times, and
Sir Jonathan Trelawney, transferred from
the poorer see of Bristol, held for eighteen
years Exeter's episcopal throne,&mdash;a "bishop-stool"
most magnificently fashioned. This
Trelawney was one of the "Seven Bishops"
who clashed with James II and were thrown
into prison. His home was in Cornwall,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
and the famous song, which may owe its
present form to the Rev. R. S. Hawker, the
eccentric vicar of Morwenstow, thunders the
wrath of the West Country:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"And have they fixed the where and when?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And shall Trelawney die?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here's twenty thousand Cornishmen<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will know the reason why."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>And speaking of vicars, the most hurried
tourist should cast a glance up to the red
tower of St. Thomas' church, for the sake of
another clergyman who dared brave a king.
The vicar of St. Thomas was conspicuous
in the West Country rebellion against the reformed
service, involving the use of an English
prayer-book, introduced by law in 1549.
The men of Devon and, even more, the men of
Cornwall, who understood the English hardly
better than the Latin, looked upon this new
form of worship as "but a Christmas game"
and could not "abide to hear of any other
religion than as they were first nuzled in."
This Exeter vicar went on chanting the Latin
liturgy and wearing his old vestments, so
that, for his contumacy, he was hanged "in
his popish apparel" from a gallows erected
on top of his own church-tower.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Of the secular buildings in Exeter, we
visited the fine-fronted guildhall in High
Street and Mol's Coffee House in the Cathedral
Yard. The custodian of the guildhall
proudly pointed out the beauties of its fifteenth-century
carvings, and hospitably invited
us to try on the gorgeous robes of the
civic dignitaries and sit in their great chairs
of fretted oak, but we contented ourselves
with viewing the various treasures of the old
burgh on exhibition there,&mdash;gold chains of
office, silver salvers and loving-cups, a huge,
two-handed sword that long since drank its
last draught of blood in the fierce grip of
Edward IV, a portrait of the Stuart princess
who, when Charles I and Queen Henrietta
were in sore straits, had been born and sheltered
at Exeter, and many another memento
of an eventful and honourable past. We
went away rapt in visions of those blithe
Midsummer Eves when all the Exeter guilds,
preceded by a mounted band consisting of
Mayor and Alderman and Council, made
the circuit of the city walls, the image of St.
Peter borne before the Fishmongers, that of
St. Luke before the Painters, and every other
trade in like manner preceded by its especial<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
patron saint; but Mol's Coffee House called
up a later picture of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Sir Francis Drake, and Martin Frobisher,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">John Hawkins, and your other English captains,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>who, with their Devonshire countrymen, Sir
Humphrey Gilbert, Sir Richard Grenville,
Sir Walter Raleigh, used to meet in the oak-panelled
hall of this Tudor mansion for such
high, adventurous talk as must have made
the wine sparkle in their cups.</p>

<p>We were a little tired in Exeter, I remember,
but instead of prying out from the west
wall of the cathedral, as we would have done
three hundred years ago, a bit of "Peter-stone"
to cure our ailments, we took a blissful
drive up the Exe,&mdash;such a trickle of a
stream just then that only regard for the
coachman's feelings restrained us from making
fun of it,&mdash;through the tranquil beauty
of Devonshire lanes, by thatched cottage
and lordly park and one dreamy little church
after another, each with its special feature of
pinnacled tower, or Saxon font, or quaint old
pew, or frieze of angel frescoes. We passed
a modest almshouse, perhaps the bequest of
husband and wife for the maintenance of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_335" id="Page_335">[335]</a></span>
four widows or two married couples. At all
events, the inscription beneath a portrait
head in relief ran:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Grudge not my laurell.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Rather blesse that Power<br /></span>

</div></div>

<p>Every mile of Devonshire has its charm,
not to be mapped out in advance, but freshly
discovered by each new lover of the moorland
and the sea, of soft air and the play of shadows,
of folklore and tradition, of the memory of
heroes. Those who cannot know fair Devon
in actual presence may find her at her best
in the romances of Kingsley and Blackmore
and Phillpotts. The shire abounds in sea-magic.
The south coast, with its wealth of
sheltered bays and tempting inlets, has so
mild and equable a climate that its dreamy
windings have become dotted with winter
resorts as well as watering-places. Lyme
Regis, on the edge of Dorset, Sidmouth and
Exmouth and Dawlish, Teignmouth, whence
Keats dated his "Endymion," and fashionable
Torquay are perhaps the most in favour,
but all the shore is warm and wonderful in
colour, set as it is with wave-washed cliffs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_336" id="Page_336">[336]</a></span>
that glisten ruddy and white and rose-pink
in the sun. These shining headlands, about
which beat the wild white wings of seagulls,
are haunted by legends wilder yet. Half-way
between Dawlish and Teignmouth are
two red sandstone pillars, the statelier with
its top suggestive of a tumbled wig, the lower
standing at a deferential tilt. In these are
shut the sinful souls of an East Devon clergyman
and his clerk, who longed too eagerly,
in the hope of their own preferment, for the
death of a Bishop of Exeter.</p>

<p>Further down the coast the health seekers
and holiday folk are somewhat less in evidence.
The old, cliff-climbing town of Brixham,
where William of Orange landed, goes
fishing for a livelihood. Dartmouth, not so
joyous to-day as when C&oelig;ur de Lion gathered
there the fleet that was to win for Christendom
the Holy Sepulchre, not so turbulent
as when Chaucer suspected his wild-bearded
seaman, little better than a pirate, of hailing
from that port, not so adventurous as when
one John Davis, of Sandridge on the Dart,
sailed out from her blue harbour with his
two small vessels, the Sunneshine and the
Moonshine, to seek a passage to China by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_337" id="Page_337">[337]</a></span>
way of the Polar sea, is mainly occupied in
the training of midshipmen. A steamer
trip up the Dart, that sudden and dangerous
stream of neighbourhood dread</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">&mdash;"River of Dart, river of Dart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Every year thou claimest a heart"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>brings us to Totnes, where, on the high authority
of Geoffrey of Monmouth, the first
king of the Britons, Brutus, grandson of the
pious Æneas, made his landing.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here I am, and here I res',<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this town shall be called Totnes."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The Brutus Stone, on which the Trojan
first set foot, is shown in irrefutable proof of
this event. In the course of the trip, the
steamer passes Greenway House, where Sir
Humphrey Gilbert was born and where, it
is claimed, the potato first sprouted in English
soil.</p>

<p>But the most momentous of all these
southern ports, Plymouth, wears an aspect
worthy of its renown. The spell of the briar-rose
has not choked its growth, although the
glamour of a glorious past enhances its
present greatness. As we gazed from Plymouth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_338" id="Page_338">[338]</a></span>
Hoe, a lofty crescent on the sea-front,
with a magnificent outlook across the long
granite break-water and the Sound alive
with all manner of shipping, past the Eddystone
Light to the Atlantic, our thoughts,
even while recognising the prosperity of this
modern naval station, flew back to those
brave old times when the steep streets and
the high bluff rang not only with the gruff
hails of bronzed sea-captains,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"dogs of an elder day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who sacked the golden ports,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>but with the merry quips and laughter of the
gay young blades who loved to ruffle it before
the Devon belles.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"How Plymouth swells with gallants! how the streets<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Glister with gold! You cannot meet a man<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But trikt in scarf and feather."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Sumptuous ocean liners call at Plymouth
now; the terrible war-ships of England ride
that ample roadstead; but we remembered
the gallant little crafts of yore, the Dreadnought
and the Defiance, the Swiftsure, the
Lion, the Rainbow, the Nonpareil, the Pelican,
the Victory, and the Elizabeth. It was
from Plymouth that Drake, "fellow-traveller<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_339" id="Page_339">[339]</a></span>
of the Sunn," put forth on the voyage that
circumnavigated the globe, and here he was
playing at bowls when on the Hoe was raised
the cry that the Spanish Armada had been
sighted. But not all the galleons of Spain
could flurry "Franky Drake."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Drake nor devil nor Spaniard feared;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Their cities he put to the sack;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He singed His Catholic Majesty's beard,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But he said, 'They must wait their turn, good souls;'<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And he stooped and finished the game."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>His statue presides over the broad esplanade,
looking steadily seaward,&mdash;a sight that
put us again to quoting Newbolt:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

</div></div>

<p>It is hard to put by those visions of the
Armada days even to think of Sir Walter
Raleigh's tragic return to Plymouth and the
block, his high heart foiled at last in its long
quest for the golden city of Manoa; and I
hardly dare confess that we quite forgot to
hunt out the special nook whence the Mayflower,
with her incredible load of furniture
and ancestors, set sail to found another
Plymouth on a bleaker shore.</p>

<p>The northern coast of Devonshire, with its
more bracing air, is no less enchanting than
the southern. Charles Kingsley, born under
the brow of Dartmoor, has lavished on North
Devon raptures of filial praise, but the scenes
of "Westward Ho!" fully bear out his glowing
paragraphs. It is years ago that I passed
an August in Clovelly, but the joy of it lingers
yet. Nothing that I have ever seen on this
our starry lodging-place, with its infinite
surprises of beauty, resembles that white
village climbing the cleft of a wooded cliff,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_341" id="Page_341">[341]</a></span>
its narrow street only a curving slope, a steep
passage here and there smoothed into steps,
where donkeys and pedestrians rub amiable
shoulders. At a turn in this cobbled stairway,
your gaze, which has been held between
two lines of the quaintest little houses, all
diversified with peaks and gables, porches
and balconies, window displays of china and
pots of flowering vines, suddenly falls to a tiny
harbour, a pier built out from the natural
rock and hung with fishing-nets, a tangle of
red-sailed boats, and a pebbly beach from
which we used to watch the sunset flushing
sea and cliffs. The five hundred dwellers
in this hanging hamlet must all be of a kin,
for Clovelly lads, we were told by our landlady,
never do well if they marry outside
the combe. Kindest of gossips! She tucked
us away as best she could in such bits of
rooms that, like Alice in Wonderland, we
had to thrust one foot up chimney and one
arm out of the window among the fuchsias
and geraniums that make nothing, in Clovelly,
of growing to a height of twenty feet.
She would put us up wonderful luncheons of
duck sandwiches and heather-honey and
lime-water delicately flavoured from the old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_342" id="Page_342">[342]</a></span>
whiskey bottles into which it was poured,
when we were starting out on those long
walks to which North Devon air and views
allure the laziest. Sometimes we followed
the Hobby Drive, a wooded avenue along the
top of the cliff, where for considerable distances
a wall of noble timber, beech and oak
and chestnut, glistening hollies and red-berried
rowans, would shut out the view, and
again the foliage would open and the eye
could range across an opal sea to Lundy
Island. On other days we would stroll
through Clovelly Court to the summit of
White Cliff, known as Gallantry Bower,
whence one may look at choice far out over
blowing woods or tossing waves. The towering
trees of the park, trees that Will Carey
may have climbed, are so ancient now that
ferns and mosses grow on their decaying
branches. Once we picked our way over
the shingles to Bucks Mill, gathering only to
drop again handfuls of the curiously flecked
and banded pebbles. The water seemed to
have as many colours as they, tans and russets
and copper-tints innumerable, with shifting
gleams of turquoise and of beryl. Bucks
Mill is a fishing-hamlet of some one hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_343" id="Page_343">[343]</a></span>
and fifty souls, representing two original families,
one of which, "the Browns," a swarthy
and passionate race, is said to descend from
Spanish sailors wrecked off the coast when
gale and billow sided with England against
the hapless Armada.</p>

<p>Another day we walked to Stoke, seven
miles thither and seven miles back, to see the
Saxon church raised by the Countess Elgitha
in gratitude for the escape from shipwreck
of her husband, Earl Godwin. All the way
we were passing cottages that seemed to have
strayed out of an artist's portfolio. Their
rosy walls of Devonshire cob&mdash;the reddish
mud of the region mixed with pebbles&mdash;were
more than half hidden by the giant
fuchsias and clambering honeysuckles. Even
the blue larkspur would grow up to the thatch.
Too often our road was shut in by hedges
and we trudged along as in a green tunnel
roofed with blue. Dahlias and hydrangias,
poppies, hollyhocks and roses filled the cottage
dooryards and gardens with masses of
bloom. We asked a woman smiling in her
vine-wreathed doorway how near we were to
Hartland. "Win the top of yon hill," she
said, "and you'll soon slip away into it."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_344" id="Page_344">[344]</a></span>
So we slipped away and were refreshed in
another cottage doorway by two glasses of
skim-milk for a penny. We found a grave
old church at Stoke, with legions of rooks
wheeling about the massive tower which has
so long been a beacon for storm-tossed mariners.
The white-bearded verger, whose rolling
gait betrayed the sailor, read to us in
stentorian tones, punctuated with chuckles,
an epitaph which, in slightly varied form,
we had seen elsewhere in Devon:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Here lies I at the church door.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Here lies I because I's poor.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The farther in, the more to pay;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But here lies I as well as they."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Our homeward walk, by a different road,
gave us a clearer impression of the ranges of
naked hilltops which make up the Hartland
parish. Upon those rounded summits rested
a mellow western light which had dimmed
into dusk when we finally risked our weary
bones on the slippery "back staircase" of
Clovelly.</p>

<p>We journeyed from Clovelly to Bideford by
carrier's cart, sitting up with what dignity
we could amidst a remarkable miscellany<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_345" id="Page_345">[345]</a></span>
of packages. Once arrived at Kingsley's
hero-town, we read, as in honour bound, the
opening chapter of "Westward Ho!" crossed
the historic bridge and sought out in the
church the brass erected to the noble memory
of Sir Richard Grenville, who drove the
little <i>Revenge</i> with such a gallant recklessness
into the thick of the Spanish fleet, fought his
immortal fight, and died of his wounds "with
a joyful and quiet mind." The exceeding
charm of this Bristol Channel coast made us
intolerant of trains and even of coaches, so
that at lovely, idle Ilfracombe we took to our
feet again and walked on by a cliff path to
Combe Martin. Here we were startled, on
going to bed, to find packed away between
the thin mattresses a hoard of green pears,
hard as marbles, and not much bigger, which
the small boy of the inn, apparently intent
on suicide, had secreted. The towered
church, some eight or nine centuries old, was
shown to us by a sexton who claimed that the
office had descended in his family from father
to son for the past three hundred years.
However that may be, he was an entertaining
guide, reading off his favourite "posy-stones"
with a relish, and interpreting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_346" id="Page_346">[346]</a></span>
carvings of the curious old rood-screen according
to a version of Scripture unlike any
that we had known before. Thence our way
climbed up for two toilsome miles through a
muddy sunken lane, in whose rock walls was
a growth of dainty fern. It was good to
come out in view of the rival purples of sunny
sea and heathery hills, good to be regaled
on "cold shoulder" and Devonshire junket
in a stone-floored kitchen with vast fireplace
and ponderous oaken settles, good to start
off again across Trentishoe Common, glorious
with gorse, and down the richly wooded
combe, past a farmyard whose great black
pig grunted at us fearsomely, and still down
and down, through the fragrance of the pines.
We turned off our track to follow the eddying
Heddon to the sea, and had, in consequence,
a stiff scramble to gain our proper path cut
high in the Channel side of the cliff. We
walked along that narrow way in a beauty
almost too great to bear, but the stress of
emotion found some relief in the attention
we had to give to our footing, for the cliff fell
sheer to the sunset-coloured waters. We
spent the night at Wooda Bay, walking on in
the morning for a jocund mile or two through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_347" id="Page_347">[347]</a></span>
fresh-scented larchwoods, then across Lee
Abbey Park and through the fantastic Valley
of Rocks, along another cliff-walk and down
a steep descent to Lynmouth, where Shelley's
"myrtle-twined cottage" stands upon the
beach. Lynmouth, where the songs of sea
and river blend, was more to our taste in its
picturesque mingling of the old and the new,
of herring-village and watering-place, than
its airy twin, Linton, perched on the cliff-top
four hundred feet above, but both are little
paradises and, having located ourselves in
one, the first thing we did was to leave it and
visit the other. We lingered for a little in
this exquisite corner of creation, till one
blithe morning we could put up no longer
with the saucy challenge of the Lyn and
chased that somersaulting sprite, that perpetual
waterfall, five miles inland, so coming
out on the heathery waste of Exmoor.</p>

<p>We would gladly have turned gipsies then
and there, if so we might have wandered all
over and over that beautiful wild upland,
and down through the undulating plain of
mid-Devon, with its well-watered pastures
and rich dairy-farms for whose butter and
cheese the Devonshire sailors, as Hakluyt's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_348" id="Page_348">[348]</a></span>
narratives tell, used to long sorely on their
far voyages. But the genuine garden of
Devon is South Hams, below Dartmoor and
between the Teign and the Tamar. This is
the apple-country of which the poet sings:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For me there's nought I would not give<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For the good Devon land,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whose orchards down the echoing cleeve<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Bedewed with spray-drift stand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hardly bear the red fruit up<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That shall be next year's cider-cup."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Little as Parson Herrick, the indignant
incumbent of Dean Prior, enjoyed his Devonshire
charge, the cider industry of the region
must have appealed to him.</p>

<p>But this broad county, outranked in size
only by York and Lincolnshire, has in its
south, as in its north, a desolate tableland.
Dartmoor has been described as a "monstrous
lump of granite, covered with a peaty
soil." The rocks are rich in lead and iron,
tin and copper, but the soil is too poor even
for furze to flourish in it. Heather, reeds,
moss and whortleberries make shift to grow,
and afford a rough pasturage to the scampering
wild ponies, the moor-sheep and red
cattle. It is a silent land of rugged tors and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_349" id="Page_349">[349]</a></span>
black morasses, of sudden mists and glooms,
of prehistoric huts, abandoned mines, and,
above all, for "Superstition clings to the
granite," of dark stories, weird spells, and
strange enchantments. Indeed, it folds a
horror in its heart,&mdash;Dartmoor Prison,
where our American sailors suffered a century
ago, and where English convicts are now
ringed in by grim walls and armed sentries.
It is said that even to-day, when a Dartmoor
child gets a burn, the mother's first remedy
is to lay her thumb upon the smarting spot
and repeat:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"There came two angels out of the west,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One brought fire, the other brought frost.<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Out, fire! In, frost!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost!<br /></span>
<span class="i8">Amen, amen, amen."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Among the mysterious groups of so-called
Druid stones is a circle known as the Nine
Maidens, for these uncouth grey shapes were
once slender girls so fond of dancing that they
would not cease on Sunday, and for that
sin were petrified. And still every Sabbath
noon these impenitent stones come to life and
dance thrice around in a circle.</p>

<h2><a name="CORNWALL" id="CORNWALL"></a>CORNWALL</h2>


<p>But the veritable Pixydom lies south of
the Tamar. In Cornwall, that stretch
of deserted moors furrowed on either
side by little river-valleys, that rocky promontory
which seems to belong more to
the kingdom of the sea than to England,
the Celtic imagination has rioted at will.
There were giants in the land in bygone
days, for the wanderer among those strangely
sculptured crags of granite, slate, and serpentine
chances at every turn on a Giant's Cradle
or a Giant's Chair, Giant's Spoon, Giant's
Bowl, Giant's Key, Giant's Hat, Giant's
Table, Giant's Well, Giant's Pulpit,
Giant's Grave. Cornishmen have heard the
music and seen the fairy dances, spied
on fairy banquets, and peeped in on fairy
funerals. The Small People have been gay
and kindly neighbours, sometimes whisking
away a neglected baby and returning the
little mortal all pink and clean, wrapped in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_351" id="Page_351">[351]</a></span>
leaves and blossoms, "as sweet as a nut."
These are the spirits of Druids, or of other
early Cornwall folk, who, as heathen, may
not go to heaven, but are too innocent for hell.
So they are suffered to live on in their old
happy haunts, but ever dwindling and dwindling,
till it is to be feared that bye and bye,
what with all the children growing stupid over
schoolbooks, and all the poets writing realistic
novels, the Small People will twinkle out of
sight. The Spriggans, lurking about the
cairns and cromlechs, where they keep guard
over buried treasures, could better be spared.
They are such thievish and mischievous trolls,
with such extraordinary strength in their ugly
bits of bodies, it is more likely they are the
diminished ghosts of the old giants. The
Piskies are nearly as bad, as any bewildered
traveller who has been Pisky-led into a bog
would testify. The only sure protection
against their tricks is to wear your garments
inside out. Many a Cornish farmer has
found a fine young horse all sweated and spent
in the morning, his mane knotted into fairy
stirrups showing plainly how some score of
the Piskies had been riding him over night.
And many a Cornish miner, deep down in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_352" id="Page_352">[352]</a></span>
earth, has felt his hair rise on his head as he
heard the <i>tap</i>, <i>tap</i>, <i>tap</i> of the Knockers, souls
of long-imprisoned Jews sent here by Roman
emperors to work the tin-mines of Cornwall.
The Brownies, who used to be so helpful
about the house, have grown shy of late and
can be depended on for assistance only when
the bees are swarming. Then the housewife
beats on a tin pan, calling at the top of her
voice: "Brownie! Brownie!" till she sees
that he has heard her and is persuading the
bees to settle. Offended mermaids have
choked up Cornish harbours and buried sea-coast
villages under sand. If you doubt it,
go and look at the little church of St. Piran&mdash;the
miners' saint, who came sailing from Ireland
on a millstone and discovered the Cornish
tin&mdash;the church that for seven centuries
was hidden under the sands and then, as the
restless winds sifted and searched them, rose
again to human sight. Spectral hounds bay
across the moors, and a phantom coach is
sometimes heard rolling with a hollow rumble
along the deep-hedged roads. Ghost ships
with all sail set drive by the shores on gusty
nights, and the Death Ship, tall, dark, square-rigged,
with black sails and a demon crew, has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_353" id="Page_353">[353]</a></span>
been known to come, in crashes of thunder
and flare of lightning, for the soul of a notorious
wrecker. Drowned sailors call from
under the tide or speed along the strand with
dripping clothes and hair. Witches, sorcerers,
fortune-tellers, charmers and "cunning
men" are among the historic characters
of Cornwall. In fact, the Witch of Freddam
still rides the seas in her coffin, stirring up
storms with her ladle and broom. The luckless
sailor who has set eyes on her will not see
his home again. Miners, too, have their
special dangers. The goblins that they sometimes
chance on underground, hunched up
into uncouth shapes or tumbling heels over
head, are not ill-met, as their presence indicates
rich lodes, but it would never do to
mark a cross on the wall of a mine gallery,
or to pass a snail on your way to the shaft
without dropping for it a morsel of tallow
from your candle. The newly dead notify
their friends of the event in many a curious
fashion, even by shaking the milk in the pans
and spoiling the clotted cream. A woman
shamed to suicide haunts her betrayer in the
form of a white hare. Cornishmen cannot
die easy on a feather-bed, nor in a house<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_354" id="Page_354">[354]</a></span>
where any key is turned or bolt is shot, nor
would they be carried to the grave by a new
road, nor buried on the north side of the
church. If rain fall&mdash;as in Cornwall it
often does&mdash;on a bier, it is a sign that the
soul has "arrived safe."</p>

<p>Amid all these supernatural influences, it
is reassuring to know that the Devil never
enters this county, having a wholesome fear
of being made into a pie. His cloven hoofs
once ventured across the Tamar, but he was
dismayed to find that the Cornish women
put everything, fish, flesh, fowl, vegetables,
whatnot, into pie. By the time poor Beelzebub
had partaken of fishy pie, stargazy pie&mdash;made
of pilchards,&mdash;conger pie&mdash;made
of eels,&mdash;lamy pie&mdash;made of kid,&mdash;herby
pie, parsley pie, and piggy pie, his nerves
gave way, and he bolted out of the shire so
precipitately that he strewed the hills and
the coast with his travelling equipment of
Devil's Bellows, Devil's Ovens, and Devil's
Frying-pans.</p>

<p>It is mainly in West Cornwall that such
fantastic figurings in the rocks are referred
to the Devil or the giants. On the eastern
moors they are more commonly attributed to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_355" id="Page_355">[355]</a></span>
King Arthur, whose Beds and Chairs and
Cups and Saucers and the Footprints of
whose horse are numerous enough to put the
skeptic out of countenance. But not only
our first encounter, as we entered Cornwall
by the east, was with King Arthur, but almost
our last, as we left the Duchy by the west,&mdash;for
this shire is proud to be known as the
Royal Duchy, claiming that the eldest son of
the Crown is born Duke of Cornwall and
only subsequently created Prince of Wales.
Within what seemed but a short time after
crossing the broad boundary stream, dotted
with sleepy craft, we found ourselves at Liskeard,
a sleepy old market-town blest with
a noble church on whose outer wall is a sundial
with the grave motto: "So soon passeth
it away." It was already late in the afternoon,
but a dark, thin, bright-eyed Cornishwoman
in the railway carriage had given us
most cheering information. Could we drive
to Dozmare Pool before sunset? Easily; it
was only a round of three or four miles and
would take us by the Devil's Cheesewring
and The Hurlers and St. Keyne's Well. The
waters of this well, she went on to tell us, have
the magic property of giving the upper hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_356" id="Page_356">[356]</a></span>
to that one of a wedded pair first drinking of
them after the ceremony; and she recited
with charming vivacity snatches of Southey's
ballad, while a burly, red-faced, blue-eyed,
beaming tourist from over the Tamar, the
only man in the compartment, blurted out
a gallantry to the effect that ladies ought to
have their way anyhow, wells or no wells,
and his silent little wife smiled a knowing
little smile.</p>

<p>The people at the inn exchanged glances
when we announced our route and although,
setting out at five, we confidently ordered
dinner at seven, the landlady slipped a packet
of sandwiches and two bottles of ginger ale
into the carriage. The coachman, thin and
dark and vivid of countenance, like all the
rest of this new Cornish world about us,
kindly but firmly refused to include in the
drive St. Keyne's Well, the Cheesewring, a
curious pile of granite blocks some thirty feet
high, whose topmost stone is so sensitive that
it whirls about three times whenever <i>it hears</i>
a cock crow, and The Hurlers, three prehistoric
stone circles reported by legend, in
its later Puritan garb, to be groups of young
Cornishmen thus enchanted for indulging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_357" id="Page_357">[357]</a></span>
on a Sunday in the traditional Cornish sport
of "hurling." Dozmare Pool was all that
our determined Jehu would undertake, although
he graciously allowed us, in passing,
a glimpse of St. Cleer's Well. This is not as
famous as the well of St. Neot the Pigmy,
who endowed the sacred waters with miraculous
virtue by standing in them, day after day,
immersed to his neck, while he repeated the
entire book of Psalms, or of various others,
but it is a spring of old renown, covered over
by a steep-pitched roof supported on time-worn
pillars and arches. The niches of this
little open-air baptistry are now empty and
its pinnacles are broken, but beside it still
stands an ancient cross. The lofty-towered
church of St. Cleer was close by, and we entered
to bow our heads for a moment under
its vaulted and timbered roof.</p>

<p>Our coachman would allow no further
pause. The sunset was already casting a
crimson light over the wastes of fern and
bracken and the earthscars of abandoned
mines, for the hills all about contain tin and
copper, which it does not pay to work. Our
old white nag&mdash;I hope his name was Merlin&mdash;seemed
incapable of fatigue. I half suspect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_358" id="Page_358">[358]</a></span>
he was a sorcery steed of metal. Up and
down the hills he scrambled with unquenchable
enthusiasm. As the sun sank into a bed
of bracken, we marvelled that the driver could
be sure of his way across those dim and featureless
moors, but he turned unerringly
from one deep lane into another. As we
drew nearer the Pool, that "middle mere"
into which Sir Bedivere flung the jewel-hilted
Excalibur, the evil powers began to array
themselves against us. For the wild spirit
Tregeagle, whose howling as he is chased by
demon dogs has been heard all over Cornwall,
is doomed for his sins in this mortal life to
labour endlessly at the hopeless task of emptying
Dozmare Pool. It is so deep&mdash;notwithstanding
the awkward fact of its going dry
in rainless summers&mdash;that not all the bell-ropes
in Cornwall can reach to its bottom,
and a thorn-bush, once flung into it, floated
out into Falmouth harbour. The bailing
must be done by a limpetshell with a hole in
it and, altogether, it is no wonder that Tregeagle's
temper has grown exceedingly
morose. For change of occupation, he is
sometimes taken to the north coast and set
to spinning ropes of sand, or is given a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_359" id="Page_359">[359]</a></span>
choked-up harbour to sweep out, but these
tasks please him no better, and the shrieks
of his torment are borne on every storm.</p>

<p>As we drove on, a light mist crept over the
meadows and defined the course of an attendant
stream. Clouds and trees took on weird
aspects. There were Druid robes floating
across the sky, misshapen figures crouching
under the hedges, menacing arms shaken from
the trees, and one wizard branch shot out and
splashed our faces with unholy dew. The
mist thickened and rose. The carriage left
the road and bumped uncertainly along till
it came to a stop at what we vaguely made
out to be the foot of a hill. For by this time
the clinging vapours had driven us into our
waterproofs and so blurred all vision that
the driver, who could not leave his fiery veteran
of a horse, would not let us attempt the
half-mile climb alone, but sent a shout
plunging through that wet, white air and
brought out some bogie of the moor embodied
as a gaunt old Cornish dame to be
our guide. Feeling her way with a stout
stick, she led us up the hill and along a stony
track where we could not see our steps nor
one another's faces. When she stayed us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_360" id="Page_360">[360]</a></span>
with her staff and said we had reached the
pool, we could discern nothing of the sort,
but reckless of life and limb we followed her
down an abrupt bank and over a hummocky
bit of ground to the very brink, as she assured
us, of the bottomless tarn. We tried to think
we saw a glimmer, although we heard not
even</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"the ripple washing in the reeds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the wild water lapping on the crag."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Lacking an Excalibur, I cast a stone into
the invisible, hoping I might hit Tregeagle,
but the hollow splash that came back aroused
such uncanny echoes we all three with one
accord skurried away and scrabbled back
down sandy ruts to the haven of the carriage.
As we gratefully munched our sandwiches,
we reflected that perhaps the mystical mere
was more impressive so than if we had actually
beheld that little fresh-water pond, about
a mile in circumference and some eight or
ten feet deep, lying on its mid-Cornwall
tableland with the crest of Brown Gilly rising
up behind. Our eyes had told us nothing
that we could urge against Malory's
geography, with its sea-route from Dozmare
to Glastonbury.</p>

<blockquote><p>"Then Sir Bedivere took the King upon his back,
and so went with him to that water side, and when
they were at the water side, even fast by the bank hoved
a little barge with many fair ladies in it, and among
them all was a queen, and all they had black hoods,
and all they wept and shrieked when they saw King
Arthur. 'Now put me into the barge,' said the King;
and so he did softly. And there received him three
queens with great mourning, and so they sat them
down, and in one of their laps King Arthur laid his
head, and then that queen said, 'Ah, dear brother,
why have ye tarried so long from me? Alas; this
wound on your head hath caught overmuch cold.' And
so then they rowed from the land, and Sir Bedivere
cried, 'Ah, my lord Arthur, what shall become of me,
now ye go from me and leave me here alone among
mine enemies?' 'Comfort thyself,' said the King,
'and do as well as thou mayst, for in me is no trust for
to trust in. For I will into the vale of Avalon to heal
me of my grievous wound.'"</p></blockquote>

<p>But the Cornish mist in which Arthur
fought his last "dim, weird battle of the west"
was to us no longer a fable.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A death-white mist slept over sand and sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With formless fear; and ev'n on Arthur fell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For friend and foe were shadows in the mist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew;<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_362" id="Page_362">[362]</a><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some had visions out of golden youth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And some beheld the faces of old ghosts<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Look in upon the battle."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Now that we had braved Tregeagle and
done the deed, that heavy mist thinned away
as suddenly as it had gathered, and when,
at ten o'clock, we reached our inn, the sky
was bright with stars, and a great moon was
slowly drifting up from the horizon.</p>

<p>But the paramount Table Round locality
in Cornwall is Tintagel on the western coast
where Arthur's Castle stands and where,
moreover, the hushed tide brought him first
from the mystery of "the great deep."</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"For there was no man knew from whence he came;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But after tempest, when the long wave broke<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All down the thundering shores of Bude and Boss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There came a day as still as heaven, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They found a naked child upon the sands<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of wild Dundagil by the Cornish sea;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that was Arthur."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>The high, bleak, rugged and desolate tract
of Bodwin Moor, at whose heart is Dozmare
Pool, lies between the four towns of Liskeard,
Bodwin, Launceston and Camelford.
This last was our starting-point for Tintagel.
We had reached Camelford by a day's journey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_363" id="Page_363">[363]</a></span>
from Penzance, setting out by train
through a country seamed all over with
abandoned surface diggings of the tin mines,
pierced by shafts and defaced by heaps of
mineral refuse to which heather was already
bringing the first healing of nature. We had
our nooning at Newquay and would have
been glad to linger on its broad beach, looking
up at the twin barrows where sleep, according
to tradition, two kings of long ago,&mdash;kings
who fought on that open headland a
whole day through and fell together at sunset,
each slain by the last thrust of the other. But
we pressed on by carriage, hardly glancing
at the long, low, stately towered church of
St. Columb Minor, and cutting short our
survey of the curious old panels, so richly
carved with sacred emblems&mdash;pelicans,
crosses, the instruments of the Passion, the
pierced hand, a heart within a crown of
thorns, the lamb, the wafer and the cup&mdash;in
the brother church of St. Columb Major.
From the depths of our Cornish road shut in
by banks and hedges some ten or twelve feet
high, we eyed the ripe blackberries hanging
well above our reach; we saw a blazing rick
on one side and, on the other, a maze of white<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_364" id="Page_364">[364]</a></span>
butterflies circling among the fuchsia trees;
we met a group of rustic mourners pushing
a bier set on wheels; and just as the hedges
began to open here and there, giving us vistas
of wheatfield, moor, and sea, we found ourselves
at Wadebridge, a little town with a
street of ivy-greened houses dignified by a
grey church-tower. We crossed a stone
bridge of many arches that seemed too big
for its river, and took train for Camelford.
On our right we had the granite masses of
Brown Willy and Rough Tor and presently,
on our left, the great gashes of the Delalobe
slate quarries.</p>

<a name="ARTHUR" id="ARTHUR"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">

<span class="caption">ARTHUR&#39;S CASTLE, TINTAGEL</span>
</div>

<p>These held the close attention of a Cornish
miner who, after forty years of fortune-seeking
in Australia, was coming home to Camelford
for a visit. He drove up with us in the
rattling wagonette, gazing on ragged hedge
and prickly furze as a thirsty soul might gaze
on Paradise. The fulness of his heart overflowed
in little laughters, though the tears
were glistening on his lashes, and in broken
words of memory and joy. He kept pointing
out to us, mere strangers that we were, not
noting and not caring what we were, the
stiles and streams and rocks associated with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_365" id="Page_365">[365]</a></span>
special events of his boyhood and youth.
As we went clattering down into the little
stone huddle of houses, we had to turn away
from the rapture in his eyes. Brothers and
sisters were waiting to greet him, with tall
children of theirs that had been to him but
names, yet the human welcome could hardly
penetrate through his dream, through his
ecstatic communion with the scene itself.
As we were driving out of Camelford early
the next morning, we caught sight of our
grizzled Cornishman once again, standing
in one of those humble doorways with the
shining still upon his face.</p>

<p>A man like that would make anybody
homesick and, to speak impartially, we
thought that Camelford was far less worthy
of such emotion than two villages we severally
remembered over sea. We fell out of
humour with the poor old town, would not
hear of it as the Arthurian Camelot,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i4">"a city of shadowy palaces<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stately,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and disdained the tradition that the blameless
king fell at Slaughter Bridge. My athletic
comrade, however, to the admiration of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_366" id="Page_366">[366]</a></span>
a flock of little schoolgirls, swung herself
down the riverbank to see his tombstone and
reported it as reading:</p>

<p class="center">
<i>Caten hic jacit filius Marconi.</i>
</p>

<p>The drive to Tintagel was through a world
of slate,&mdash;slate everywhere. There were
slate walls, slate houses, heaps of slate-refuse,
banks of broken slate feathered with gorse
and heather, yawning mouths of disused
slate quarries. We passed through defiles
where slate was piled cliff-high on either
side. Slate steps led up to the footpaths that
ran along the top of the hedge-banks. By
way of this forsaken region we came to a
sleeping town. Tintagel Church lay before
us, hoary, silent. Not a soul was in the
streets,&mdash;not the fierce ghosts of Gorlois
and of Uther Pendragon, nor the sad ghost
of Igraine, nor the loving ghosts of Tristram
and Iseult. We left the carriage and
climbed by slippery paths to Arthur's Castle,
which is no castle, but a colossal confusion
of tumbled rocks, some heaped and mortared
once by human hands, some grouped in the
fantastic architecture of nature. There we
sat astonished and dismayed, for the place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_367" id="Page_367">[367]</a></span>
is like a robber hold, a den of pirates fortified
against the land, rather than a court of chivalry.
But the scene was superbly beautiful.
The ocean on which we looked was a dazzling
blue, and far to north and south stood out
the stern, dark outlines of the coast. The
sunshine that filled the surf with shimmering
tints gleamed on the white plumage of a gull
enthroned on the summit rock of the castle,&mdash;most
likely the spirit of Guinevere, for
Arthur, when he revisits Tintagel, comes as
the Cornish chough,</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Talons and beak all red with blood,"&mdash;<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>a bird which no true Cornishman will shoot.</p>

<p>The monstrous crags and huge fragments of
old wall were cleft in a fashion strongly suggestive
of</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"casements opening on the foam<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of perilous seas in fairylands forlorn,"<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>and we shuddered to imagine with what stupendous
force the terrible tides of winter
must beat against that naked coast.</p>

<p>We realised what the fury of the sea-winds
here must be as we strolled through the
churchyard, whose slate slabs are buttressed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_368" id="Page_368">[368]</a></span>
with masonry and, even so, tip and lean over
those graves too old for grief. All is ancient
about Tintagel church, and most of all the
Norman font whose sculptured faces are
worn dim and sleepy with innumerable years,
each year bringing its quota of babies for the
blessing of the holy water.</p>

<a name="BOSCAST" id="BOSCAST"></a>
<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
<img src="images/i_420.jpg" width="600" height="439" alt="BOSCASTLE" title="" />
<span class="caption">BOSCASTLE</span>
</div>

<p>We had to leave it,&mdash;the mysterious
Titanic ruin with its bracken blowing in the
wind, the sheep, chained in couples, that
prick their silly noses on nettles and furze, the
old church, where bells tolled without ringers
on the day that Arthur fell, the old wayside
cross, the old stone dovecote in the vicarage
garden, but not the cliffs and the sea. For
we drove up the coast to Boscastle, pausing
on the way&mdash;and that was our mistake&mdash;to
see the little church of Forrabury. This
is the church that longed for a peal of bells
to rival those of Tintagel, but when the vessel
that brought the bells was waiting for the tide
to take her into the harbour, and the pilot was
thanking God for a fair voyage, the captain
laughed and swore that it was only their own
good seamanship they had to praise, whereupon
a mighty billow, far out at sea, swept
down upon the ship and overwhelmed her,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_369" id="Page_369">[369]</a></span>
only the devout pilot escaping with his life.
And ever since&mdash;so ballad and guide-book
assured us&mdash;the tower of Forrabury church
has stood voiceless, though a muffled knell,
when a storm is coming up, is heard beneath
the waves. What then was our righteous
wrath on finding this venerable edifice
all newly done up in pink frescoes,&mdash;yes,
and with an ornate bell-rope of scarlet twist
hanging beneath the tower!</p>

<p>The harbour of Boscastle is a rock-walled
inlet somewhat resembling that of Pasajes in
the north of Spain. Curving promontories
shut in a tidal stream that runs green in the
sun and purple in the shadow. Swift lines
of creaming foam glint across where the river
yields itself up to the strong currents of the
sea,&mdash;a sea which, as we saw it that brilliant
September afternoon, twinkled with myriad
points of intolerable light.</p>

<p>How can the pen cease from writing about
Cornwall? And yet it must. There is a
devil&mdash;a printer's devil&mdash;that counts our
idle words. I may not tell of wind-swept
Morwenstow, where Tennyson and Hawker
roamed the wave-fretted cliffs together and
talked of the Table Round, nor of lofty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_370" id="Page_370">[370]</a></span>
Launceston, with its ivied Norman keep and
great granite church whose outer walls are
covered with elaborate carving. The sculptured
figure of Mary Magdalen at the east
end, lying on her face in an attitude of extreme
dejection, is regularly stoned by the
boys for luck, and flints and shards were
lodged, when we saw her, all over her poor
back. I may not tell of Bodwin, either, with
its memory of a mayor who took a prominent
part in the West Country revolt against the
reformed service. As a consequence, when
the agitation was over he was called upon to
entertain the royal commissioner, who hanged
his host after dinner.</p>

<p>It is a pity not to have space to suggest the
softer beauties of the south coast. From
Truro, after a visit to its new cathedral with
its holy memory of Henry Martyn, we drove
by way of Sunny Cove to Malpas. The gulls
were screaming as they sought their dinner on
the flats, and a man, wading through the pools,
was gathering up belated little fishes in his
hands. We sailed between wooded banks
down the Fal to Falmouth, which is watched
over by the garrisoned castle looming on Pendennis
Head. The old port lies in picturesque<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_371" id="Page_371">[371]</a></span>
disorder along the inlet, while the new town
stands handsomely on the height above.
Here we saw, in lawns and gardens, a semi-tropical
vegetation, yuccas, acacias, bamboos,
aloes, palms, and pampas grass. Would
that there were time to tell the smuggling
scandals of the Killigrews, that witty and
graceless family who ought to have learned
better from their Quaker neighbours, the
Foxes! It was by a Killigrew that Falmouth
was founded in the reign of the first Stuart,
and Killigrews made merry in Arwenach
House, and made free with the merchandise
of foreign ships, for many a pleasant year.
The time when piracy could be counted an
aristocratic amusement has gone by in Falmouth,
as well as the bustling days when this
port was an important packet station whence
coaches and postchaises went speeding up to
London. It is now putting on the gentler
graces and coming into repute as a winter
resort, though it has not yet attained the
popularity of Penzance.</p>

<p>On our way from the one to the other we
passed through the mining town of Redruth,
near which, in the hollow known as Gwennap
Pit, Wesley addressed vast audiences. On one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_372" id="Page_372">[372]</a></span>
occasion the number was reckoned as thirty-two
thousand. "I shall scarce see a larger
congregation," he wrote, "till we meet in the
air." The more mystical doctrines of Fox
took little hold on the rough fishermen and
miners of Cornwall, but Wesley practically
converted the Duchy, turning it from the
most lawless corner of England, a lair of
smugglers and wreckers, into a sober, well-conducted
community. As little flames are
said to be seen playing about a converted
Cornishman, Wesley's path across the county
must have been a veritable Milky Way. In
such natural amphitheatres as Gwennap Pit,
it may be that the Cornish Miracle Plays, so
far excelling the English in freedom of fancy
and symbolic suggestion, were given. We
looked wistfully from Hayle over to St. Ives,
with its long line of fishing boats tied up like
horses to a church fence, but since we could
follow only one road at once, held on our way
to Penzance.</p>

<p>Beautiful for situation, the "Holy Headland"
looks out over waters exquisitely
coloured toward</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"the great Vision of the Guarded Mount,"<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_373" id="Page_373">[373]</a></span></div></div>

<p>St. Michael's Mount, a solemn cone, fortress-crowned,
above which a praying hermit, when
the setting sun was flooding the skies with
splendour, might easily have deemed he saw
the guardian wings of the Archangel. As all
Cornish children know, this mount was built
by the giant Cormoran and rose, in those
days when Mount's Bay was a fertile plain of
several parishes, from the midst of a forest,
"a hoare rock in a wood." It was the scene
of the glorious exploit of Jack the Giant-Killer,
who was afterwards appointed tutor
to King Arthur's eldest son in that special
branch of warfare. Cornwall is so fond of its
old giants that it sometimes, so folklorists say,
confuses their deeds with those of the saints.
But it loves its saints, too, who are said to be
more numerous than the saints in Paradise.
Cornish churches stand open all day long, and
old Cornwall's affectionate name for the
Virgin was "Aunt Mary."</p>

<p>The view ranges on across Mount's Bay to
The Lizard, that peninsula so beautiful with
its serpentine cliffs and Cornish heath, the
wildest and loneliest part of all wild and
lonely Cornwall; but our route lay to its
companion point on the southwest. Our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_374" id="Page_374">[374]</a></span>
driver literally knew every inch of the road
and pointed out to us cross after cross, and
cromlech after cromlech,&mdash;such vague old
stones, worn featureless and almost formless,
built into walls, half sunken under the turf,
embedded in banks, peering at us from across
a field, thrusting a grey visage through a
hedge,&mdash;sometimes a mere time-eaten stump,
sometimes a heathen monolith with the afterthought
of a crucifix rudely graved upon it,
sometimes a complete square cross. These
last we often found in churchyards, set up on
stone platforms approached by a flight of
steps. Such was the one we noted in the
churchyard of St. Buryan, another of those
long, low, lofty-towered old churches characteristic
of Cornwall.</p>

<p>As we neared Penberth Cove, the Atlantic
opened out to view, its sparkling turquoise
relieved by one white sail. It was in Penberth
Cove that there once lived a bedridden
old woman, a good old soul, about whose
one-roomed cottage the Small People, to
divert her, used to sport all day, catching her
mice and riding them in and out of holes in
the thatch, dancing the dust off the rafters
and giving trapeze and tight-rope performances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_375" id="Page_375">[375]</a></span>
on the cobwebs. The valley runs
green to the sea and we left the carriage for
a walk across the fields, a walk diversified
by stiles of all known species, to Treryn
Castle. This monstrous fastness of heaped
rock and jagged crag was built by a giant
who was such a clever necromancer that all
he had to do was to sit in the Giant's Easy-chair,
to whose discomfort we can testify,
and will the castle to rise out of the sea. For
latter-day necromancy, our guide pointed
out Porthcurnow Beach, where, he said, six
submarine cables land. He was a native of
the coast, a fisherman, and gave us eyes to
see the gulls rejoicing over their feast of
pilchards, and ears to hear the whistle of a
young otter. The Lion of Treryn is the
Logan Rock, but we first encountered, in our
scramble over the crags, Lady Logan, a
stumpy personage whose hood and skirt,
though recognisable, are of the Stone Age
fashion. This granite beauty is so sensitive
in her feelings that she trembles at a touch.
As we climbed higher among the rocks, in
the exhilarating air, we won views ever more
wonderful of rolling green billows shattered
into clouds of spray upon the shore. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_376" id="Page_376">[376]</a></span>
Logan itself is an enormous rocking-stone,&mdash;a
boulder weighing some seventy tons delicately
balanced on cubical masses of rock.
It does not, like the rocking-stone in Burma
on which a little pagoda has been built, oscillate
in the wind, but swings at a sturdy
push. It was formerly more easily swayed
than now, for a mischievous young Goldsmith,
nephew of the poet who was himself
so prankishly inclined, undertook in 1824,
when commanding a revenue cutter off this
coast, to dispel the popular notion that no
human force could dislodge Logan Rock.
On the eighth of April, though the first
would have been more appropriate, he landed
with a crew of eight men, meaning to tip the
stone over into the sea. But he only succeeded
in moving it some four feet to the left
and, even so, found his escapade an expensive
one, for it cost ten thousand dollars to
replace the ponderous mass&mdash;as the anger
of the people compelled the Admiralty to
order him to do&mdash;on its original pivot.
With all his efforts, he could not hit the perfect
poise, and whereas Logan Rock once
had the power of healing sick children who
were rocked upon it, that spell no longer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_377" id="Page_377">[377]</a></span>
works. It was not the right hour for us to
ascertain whether touching the stone thrice
three times would still make a woman a
witch. This test should be undertaken at
midnight, when a battalion of sympathetic
hags, mounted on stems of ragwort, would
be hooting encouragement from their favourite
rendezvous at the towering crag south
of Logan Rock known as Castle Peak.</p>

<p>We returned to our carriage and drove on.
The fields of gorse and heather suddenly
slipped over foaming reefs and we were at
Land's End. Great waves were churning
themselves white against the ledges. A few
sails glinted on the horizon; a few gulls were
perching on the rocks; but we were, at first,
aware of nothing save the steep, broken wall
of granite and the strange, compelling song
of the Atlantic. By degrees we noted light-houses,
bays, and a curious cavern, with such
wave-eaten arches as we had seen at Biarritz,
beneath our very feet. We walked along
the edge of the cliffs, green with turf to the
sheer plunge. At places, indeed, the heather
runs down the rocks to meet the tide. We
passed close by gulls that stood unstartled
in this their own domain of crags and spray-dashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_378" id="Page_378">[378]</a></span>
gorges, eyeing severely the approach
of uninvited guests.</p>

<p>The sun was setting and we could distinguish
the Scilly Isles like gold cloudlets resting
on the sea. Between these islands and
Land's End once bloomed the lost Arthurian
realm of Lyonesse. But weary of the past
and its dim fables, our hearts followed that
rippling line of splendour further and further
west, far out across the Atlantic to the land
of hope and promise, the strong young land
that fronts the future, vowed to the great
adventure of human brotherhood.</p>
